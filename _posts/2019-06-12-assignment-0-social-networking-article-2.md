## Allison Cox
RIZE 3D printers are one of a kind, as stated in the article, RIZE One 3D printer uses both extrusion and inkjet processes in tandem to create unique results, they also are the only office-safe 3D printer, with no toxic particle emissions, mess or harmful materials throughout the process. Ira Green is using these 3D printers to create prototypes and manufacturing aids. These printers have a “holding space” to hold the piece besides clamping it for accuracy and reduction of labor. I think anything item that creates accuracy and is less labor intensive is product worth investing in.

This article shows how 3D printing has revolutionized manufacturing and optimized cost saving and time. Where Ira Green previously spent $300 and two days on each fixture prototype iteration, the implementation of 3D printing reduced these costs to $2 and under an hour per iteration. The interesting part is that they found this use for the fixtures but the possibilities for additive manufacturing are unlimited and there can be more room to explore and grow with other products and even final parts. I would like to see them taking the idea of creating spare parts for the machinery to the next level and start producing similar products to sell them

This was a very interesting article. It discussed the first and only 3D printer with no toxic particle emissions, mess or harmful materials throughout the process and without post-processing after printing. As Lorena mentioned $300 and two days on each fixture prototype to now only being $2 and instead of 2 days its now just an hour that's is amazing. I hope they are able to give this printer proper updates like maybe making a little sleeker so it doesn't take up much space or maybe find way to cut down on time even more. All in all this is a great example of how technology can dramatically improve any business modal or process. I will be following this particular project closely as it develops.

This article not only discussed a different type of 3D printer, but discussed the practical use during production. Prior to the use of 3D printing, the company used CNC programming which can take more time to complete different fixtures and production aids. 300 fixtures had been printed in the last year at a cost of two dollars per part, which shows that 3D printing is not always an expensive option. This use of the 3D printer proved to be time efficient and also cost efficient. The some other time savings in this process wa more efficient changeovers and eliminating errors. Errors can cause wasted time down the line of production, so the elimination of this is a great advantage in production.

This article also ties in nicely with the other two.  There are a couple of points made in this article that supports some of the things that we will be learning in this Project Management class.   The comment about how the ability of fixtures to hold pieces allows for more accuracy supports the concept of quality.  The new technology is reducing backlog and allowing for faster response.  These are two things that also supports what we’ll be learning in the class.  There is also a “Green” element mentioned in the article where it discusses that Rize’s 3D printer doesn’t produce toxic particles and harmful materials.  This is a principle that will be highly emphasized in our class.  Finally, the new technology discussed in the article saves time and produces a lower priced product.  Sounds like they have this project management thing figured out.

Businesses all over the globe are looking for ways to save, and the RIZE 3D printer has provided savings in both the bottom line and in the process. The printer allows Ira Green to create more, eliminate errors, and save all at the same time. This article is a good example of upfront cost versus an efficient cost over time. The Rize One 3D printer does not have a listed price on their website (<https://www.rize3d.com/rize-one/>), which shows it could be a pricey piece for any company interested in purchasing one. As a project manager, the main goal is to deliver a project on time, under budget, and within the appropriate risk level. The Rize One 3D printer has allowed Ira Green to do all three of those things with one purchase. Ira Green can now limit errors, save $298 per piece, and make more items over a shorter period of time.

Bottlenecking is a term used to identify the step of production restricting throughput. Ira Green Inc (IGI), encountered a severe bottleneck in the design and manufacturing of custom fixtures. Using a total quality approach, the process was revised to not only increase the bottom-line but integrate sustainable green project management too. Originally, IGI suffered from eight hours of Computer Numerical Coding for each fixture which cost $300. As the title reads, “Ira Green makes 80% time saving on fixtures with RIZE 3D printing” (Griffith). In addition, material expense was reduced by 99.4% concurrently. Impressive as is, the true admiration of this article highlights Rize One; “the only office safe 3D printer, with no toxic particle emission, mess or harmful materials throughout the process and without post-processing after printing” (Griffith). Taking the steps in sustainable green project management must be sought after for every application.

At the present time, we need innovative techniques in engineering manufacturing as many the better since nowadays the development of 3D printing is increasing and its been in use in almost everywhere from the medical field to the aerospace area. Ira Green Inc., used Rize technology which transforms its production process. With this new development, the 3D printer is more user-friendly which can reduce the time and cost of sourcing in ordering machine parts on demand. Beside IRA Green Inc., there are many more companies out there taking steps to innovate their ideas which can benefit not only in manufacturing but also cost-effective, contains unique capabilities and most importantly ecologically friendly. New techniques in printing provide more efficient use of resources and minimize the harmful impact on the environment by virtually eliminating errors.
