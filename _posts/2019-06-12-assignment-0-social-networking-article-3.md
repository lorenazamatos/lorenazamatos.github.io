## Allison Cox
The article discusses, Aluminum Association introduces AM alloy which helps prevent hot cracking and retain full strength to the part during the 3D printing process. While creating this material they discussed with HRL Laboratories regarding the registration process of their aluminum. AA wanted to make the alloy the first AA-registered aluminium material for additive manufacturing. Both companies allowed this by creating different registration numbers for their products that are trackable. I appreciate the idea that two companies work together to create a better product, and generate a tracking system for their pieces of material.

The 18 month validation process was very worthwhile. This alloy will set a precedent that can change the manufacturing processes for companies with higher safety and traceability standards like the ones mentioned in the article, automotive and aerospace. This alloy was carefully engineered but could not be used without being validated by companies that have stricter regulations. I think other metals and alloys will continue to be introduced to the market and validated as the concept spreads. I think that this idea can be very productive in the medical device field where all the materials and the processes need to be verified as well.

This article is about the introduction of AM alloy. Alloy is very important because it prevents various situations where cracking could occur during the 3D print. HRL Laboratories and Aluminum Association both collaborated to make an amazing product. I love this kind of situation because this is where the corporations focus on the bigger picture rather than feuding over ownership and causing the product to go under due to lack of collaboration and lack of growth opportunity.

For the Aluminum Association, AA, to set up a system to be able to register additive manufactured alloys is a step in the correct direction. More and more specialized materials are being made in response to specific needs for the 3D printing process, and to be able to register/catalog these alloys will make it better for all users, as there will be standards. Specifically, the high-strength aluminum alloy with nanoparticles will be useful to 3D printing. It’s potential future uses in a variety of fields, both aerospace and automotive, seem limitless. The development and commercialization of new material alloys alongside the system for registration, will allow for continued improvements and developments in the role that material science plays in manufacturing.

It’s interesting to read that aluminum is registered by a regulatory agency much like electrical products are registered by agencies such as IEEE or Underwriters Laboratory.  This article also ties in nicely with the article about 3D printing.  Before reading these two articles, I knew nothing about 3D printing.  Professor Ranky discusses how tough it is to keep the competitive edge in business. I’ve notice that in the renewable energy sector that some of the companies that were leaders in the early phases of the industry are no longer around.  It will be interesting to see if HRL Laboratories , being the first to validated their high-strength aluminum with the Aluminum Association, can keep the competitive edge that surely has come with this accomplishment.

HRL has created an alloy that they can commercialize and traces back to them. This alloy prevents materials from heat cracking under the extreme conditions of a 3D printer. It also keeps a product at full strength which will avoid productions issues down the line and maintain proper quality in all products that pass through the 3D printing process. From a project managers point of view, if I were an outside company interested in buying this product I would acknowledge the potential savings I would receive by avoiding low quality products that were damaged during the 3D printing process. If I could save myself hassle down the line by purchasing a single product, the risk to reward ratio would be forever in my favor and would help me feel more comfortable with my choice. HRL is also very wise to register this alloy back to them, because they will be the key creators of this product that companies will want to get their hands on. This allows them to sell a product that is needed across the industry and maintain a sustainable product.

This article shows how HRL laboratory has made a breakthrough in designing advanced printing engineering. The laboratory has developed a technique to 3D print high strength aluminum alloys without damaging the material and process itself. I think this growth in 3D printing is an advantage to the manufacturing of engineering related alloys. It’s a phenomenon that HRL laboratory discovers this nano functionalization technique which enables to 3D print high strength aluminum alloy which is used in aerospace and automotive operations. In my opinion, parts welded together are essential in the manufacturing area, this 3D printer technique provides a great future for automotive or aircraft engineering, etc where parts can be manufactured quickly, accurately, and more importantly with high strength materials.

Manufacturing has come a long way in the past four decades. The most notable transformation would be significant reduction of paper usage. Taking the steps in sustainable green project management, HRL Laboratories has pioneered a powder Aluminum alloy suitable for 3D printing. Such technology infers the end produce is only clicks-away. In theory, the user has the ability to create a CAD design in the morning, print the part on their lunch break, and begin quality testing all in one eight hour day. If the part requires revision, simply melt and reuse the same high strength aluminum. As a Total Quality Approach, customers are satisfied sooner for a fraction of the cost; reason being the removal of costly bottlenecks such as detailed drawing, purchasing material, and fabrication lead time all require additional time, funds, and even paper.
