## Video Analysis

### 1. FordRougeBody-ViPodLx.m4v

This video is a tour of Ford's Dearborn, MI truck plant.  The plant was built with sustainability in mind, segregating the automated parts of the plant from the manned parts because robots do not need creature comforts like air conditioning.  Their pallets are reusable, and can change dimensions depending on the chassis platform.  The pallet communicates with the robot welders and sealers so that each robot runs the proper program.  This way the same system can run for different cars.  Robots also handle part alignment, which avoids the need for a vision system in the assembly step.  They do employ a perceptron vision system to autonomously inspect each underbody assembly for defects with millimeter accuracy.  Their fixtures are similarly flexible, and in the video, only two of the four sides were actually loaded with parts, meaning the plant has capacity overhead in terms of the models it can produce.

### 2. COGNEX-Vision-Inspect-ViPodLx.m4v

This video is a demonstration of the COGNEX vision system for dimensional gauging, defect inspection, robot guidance, and identification.  The demo system is seen measuring a part as an example of gauging and defect inspection, identifying parts via a data matrix code laser-etched onto each part, and identifying/locating a logo printed on each part and analyzing said logo for tolerance.  The dimensional gauging application is capable of locating a fixture and comparing its dimensions to an expectation against a threshold or tolerance.  Expectations are set via geometric shapes, and the system analyzes the contrast in the image to identify edges.  The system can also record a time-series of the measurements it takes, which can feed statistical quality control programs such as Six Sigma.  COGNEX can do the analysis, or export the data to another system.  The system is poised to enable 3D guidance with a single camera.  The system analyzes the perspective distortion from a golden master part in order to calculate position and orientation in space.

### 3. Corvette-Design-720p.mov

This video is a walkthrough of the Corvette C6's rolling chassis.  The chassis combines many different metals and materials, including balsa wood with carbon fiber bracing for the floorboard.  The interviewer asked why Chevy did not use honeycomb, and they...didn't really answer the question, except to say that they had used balsa in prior vehicles and it worked well.  The siderails are hydroformed and run seamlessly front-to-back the length of the chassis, with smooth curves.  The engine is an LS7, which nobody will buy because it turns this car into a deathtrap.  Seriously, the C6 with a 7-liter is a kite capable of traveling at 195 miles per hour, but the chief engineer thinks it's still safe because it has run-flat tires.  No amount of carbon fiber is going to keep you intact when you hit the median trying to race the first Tesla you meet on the turnpike.

### 4. DigiLife-632568001368-ViPod.m4v

This appears to be an ancient wearable tech fashion show from before the dot-com bubble burst.  Many successful products were presented, like the Handspring Visor, Motorola Timeport cell phone, and various two-way pagers.  A "wireless web service" called Yada Yada was presented multiple times throughout the show, indicating that they were a heavy sponsor, but a cursory Google search yields no further information on what they actually provided.  Several head-mounted displays were presented.  Some look like very early Google Glass prototypes, and others like Oculus Rift prototypes.  Some of the presentations were outright bizarre, like an entire series of technological dating aids.

### 5. Rwood-Hurricane-ViPodLx-Ranky-Copyright.m4v

This video shows the cleanup effort after the "Ridgewood Hurricane" of August 2005.  Since no actual hurricane touched NJ in that year, I assume the term Hurricane is hyperbole.  Workers systematically clear downed trees and branches from the street using industrial woodchippers.  They also finish felling structurally compromised trees that stayed standing.
