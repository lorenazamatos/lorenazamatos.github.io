1. In each assignment in this class please focus on What Problems You Want to Solve and How? What NEW value does your company offer (i.e. 'Value Proposition') in what Customer Segment? This will make you a more efficient and better professional.

GreenSpeed aspires to be a distributor and service provider company with faster service, paperless and environmentally friendly by delivering what the customer wants in a timely manner and with clean environmental consciousness for the company and the traders. The vehicles used for the transportation are electric. The mission of the company is to help a client and the client futures at the same time. We believe that all people if given the choice will choose to preserve our world, it is the responsibility of the companies and other entities out there to provide the cleanest and best products for the planet. Our market will start being the buyers of the products for the manufacturers (list the 4 company) but in time, GreenSpeed can grow to be a Fedex or UPS-like carrier for many other manufacturers. As many other distributors, this company will facilitate the sales of the 4 (companies) and will directly deal with the customer, but we will deliver a little extra.

2. Imagine, that you are setting up your own company, the 5th company. Document in about 1 page the following: What is the new green quality-focused civil engineering, or construction engineering, architectural, IT/IS, management product / process / service / or project management your company plans to develop?

GreenSpeed is a distributor and service provider with a strong customer focus that will also be extremely environmentally friendly. One thing that sets this company apart is the way we conduct our deliveries with electric vehicles.
In general, we the company applies the lean manufacturing principles and focuses on the reduction of waste, but one aspect that sets the company apart is how much energy is being saved in the transportation process. GreenSpeed took a visionary step and invest in electric cars and trucks to conduct all the deliveries. There was a downside to the initial investment from buying the electric vehicles, but this are a lot more efficient and less damaging to the planet. In uncertain times like this, investing in more reliable sources of energy is the long-term solution. Now, the price associated with deliveries will be more stable regardless of the variation of electricity. There is a lot more ways to obtain electric energy that the limited amount of fossil fuels in this planet.

Our company have an incredible logistics system and relationship with the manufacturers that allows them to have minimal product in inventory and will incur to do so in times to reduce delivery time and back-up orders. The company also have certified field technicians that offer repair and service the equipment that we sell. The good relationship maintained with the production also allows for a downstream of current and validated training. When you buy something from GreenSpeed, there is no need to contact the manufacturer as contacting the company directly is more effective and time saving. The purchase orders (PO) and all the documents are paperless as we have electronic signatures and software that allows us to not print and waste any paper. We focus on the reduction of waste, to speed up the process and reduce waste. All of the emails in the company have an attachment with a “please think about the trees before printing this email” we believe that this can be a little step to start revolutionizing the world as we know it.

3. Document in a few (8-10) sentences: What will your company work on, and how will it collaborate with the other 4 companies (in the eLearning Pack)? (Even if you find these collab. companies not to fit; that is done on purpose to trigger your innovative thoughts!)

**Harrington**

Harrington's material stands and baskets will be used to optimize space and inventory.  This will allow us to apply the 5S principles to make our warehouse look pristine.  Their hoists will also help with moving product around, as well as loading processes.  In addition to the internal usage detailed here, we will also be distributing Harrington's full catalog of products.  Since we use what we distribute in production, we will be better equipped to serve our customers.

{: .no-indent }
**ISCAR**

ISCAR's cutting tools will enable us to quickly fabricate any parts we need in the development and maintenance of our all-electric fleet.  In addition to the internal usage detailed here, we will also be distributing ISCAR's full catalog of products.  Since we use what we distribute in production, we will be better equipped to serve our customers.

**DC threading technology**

Similar to ISCAR, DC Swiss makes threading tools are specially designed to work on the aluminum alloys used in both aircraft and new electric vehicle components.  The video at (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4vaOTWYOo&t=407s>) does a good job of illustrating the difficulty of cleaning aluminum buildup from regular carbide tools not designed for such a task.  Our lean production process would benefit greatly from avoiding the downtime and cost incurred.  In addition to the internal usage detailed here, we will also be distributing DC Swiss's full catalog of products.  Since we use what we distribute in production, we will be better equipped to serve our customers.

**RAFI GmbH**

RAFI's control components will enable us to develop bespoke controls for our warehouse systems.  This is instrumental to both TQM and Lean, as the ergonimics of work stations can be a big source of waste in the production process.  Being able to build our own control surfaces grants us a competitive advantage.  In addition to the internal usage detailed here, we will also be distributing RAFI's full catalog of products.  Since we use what we distribute in production, we will be better equipped to serve our customers

4. Describe all above with a quality project management and a Sustainable Green focus. You can find good ideas for these if you read the first Chapter of the eBook, as well as Appendix A. These can trigger good ideas to innovate! Take each principle from the eBook Chapter and address it explicitely how you will deal with it in your (i.e. in the 5th) company? Pls. don't try to write a novel. This is a technical document. Please follow this structure I give you in the syllabus. It makes it easier for everybody. Address each important aspect point by-point. Don't forget the Quality Project Management focus!

The company’s initiative is based on the customer wanting and the voice that have been ignored for quite a while now. Clean forms of energy will not only be more appealing for the customer and will boost revenue, but it will also allow for better returns in the long term. Fossil fuels are a limited source of energy and whoever maters a more sustainable source of energy now and for the future  will surely conquers the industry.

5. You have to spell out the TQM focus and Sustainable Green Quality aspects of your company! (Many students forget this !) You can find here more on Green Engineering: <http://www.cimwareukandusa.com/All-Green/Ranky-GreenEngineering.html>

This project is made with a fusion of TQM and sustainable green Quality approach. This company is focus on delivering the best service and parts to the customer in a timely manner, by reducing the over processing and backload that the manufacturer have. This company have good and strong relationship with the suppliers that allow GreenSpeed to have instantaneous communication and an updated statues of the processes and product that we sell. Training and non-conforming product will be capture first hand too thanks to the flow of information between the vendor and us. The logistics will be kept a minimum only to allow for faster deliveries, counting on the especially fast ability to obtain product. Cost and benefits will be maximized through an rather larger initial investment that will guaranty that the results can be more efficiently obtain with a possibility for growth and stability. The TQM and Sustainable Green Quality principles  are applied in this  from the beginning of the concept and with a prioritized customer focus and approach to the ways the process is conceived throughout. Among this we can mention the designed that was thought to maintain prices stable and keep the company ahead of the curve, cost and waste reduction, not only of steps and non-added value but also unnecessary waste like paper and fossil fuels and bringing to the table the green engineering that will deliver to the clients a clean-conscious alongside with incredible service. In general the company have a waste “Red” mentality, where that allows the internal culture to spread and helps GreenSpeed becoming one of the best places in the world to work for.

6. Besides the business plan in this assignment, please select and review 5 videos in your eLearning Pack and write a short 200-250 word, or so long summary on each of the selected videos (in the 'V' marked DVD in your eLearning Packs), focusing on TQM and Sustainable Green aspects: For each video you should furthermore answer the following two questions in 3-4 sentences each: What quality project management lessons have I learned from the video, or video clip, or slide show video, that I could implement in my 5th company? and What Sustainable and Green Quality aspects did I find useful for my 5th company? (Note, that in Appendix B you'll see a lot about pollution issues...)

**FordRougeBody-ViPodLx.m4v**

This video is a tour of Ford's Dearborn, MI truck plant.  The plant was built with sustainability in mind, segregating the automated parts of the plant from the manned parts because robots do not need creature comforts like air conditioning.  Their pallets are reusable, and can change dimensions depending on the chassis platform.  The pallet communicates with the robot welders and sealers so that each robot runs the proper program.  This way the same system can run for different cars.  Robots also handle part alignment, which avoids the need for a vision system in the assembly step.  They do employ a perceptron vision system to autonomously inspect each underbody assembly for defects with millimeter accuracy.  Their fixtures are similarly flexible, and in the video, only two of the four sides were actually loaded with parts, meaning the plant has capacity overhead in terms of the models it can produce.

**COGNEX-Vision-Inspect-ViPodLx.m4v**

This video is a demonstration of the COGNEX vision system for dimensional gauging, defect inspection, robot guidance, and identification.  The demo system is seen measuring a part as an example of gauging and defect inspection, identifying parts via a data matrix code laser-etched onto each part, and identifying/locating a logo printed on each part and analyzing said logo for tolerance.  The dimensional gauging application is capable of locating a fixture and comparing its dimensions to an expectation against a threshold or tolerance.  Expectations are set via geometric shapes, and the system analyzes the contrast in the image to identify edges.  The system can also record a time-series of the measurements it takes, which can feed statistical quality control programs such as Six Sigma.  COGNEX can do the analysis, or export the data to another system.  The system is poised to enable 3D guidance with a single camera.  The system analyzes the perspective distortion from a golden master part in order to calculate position and orientation in space.

**Corvette-Design-720p.mov**

This video is a walkthrough of the Corvette C6's rolling chassis.  The chassis combines many different metals and materials, including balsa wood with carbon fiber bracing for the floorboard.  The interviewer asked why Chevy did not use honeycomb, and they...didn't really answer the question, except to say that they had used balsa in prior vehicles and it worked well.  The siderails are hydroformed and run seamlessly front-to-back the length of the chassis, with smooth curves.  The engine is an LS7, which nobody will ever buy.  Seriously, the base C6 is already a deathrap.  Adding a 7-liter turns it into a kite capable of making 195 miles per hour, but the chief engineer thinks it's still safe because it run-flats are an option.  No amount of carbon fiber is going to keep you intact when you hit the median trying to race the first Tesla you meet on the turnpike.

**DigiLife-632568001368-ViPod.m4v**

This appears to be an ancient wearable tech fashion show from before the dot-com bubble burst.  Many successful products were presented, like the Handspring Visor, Motorola Timeport cell phone, and various two-way pagers.  A "wireless web service" called Yada Yada was presented multiple times throughout the show, indicating that they were a heavy sponsor, but a cursory Google search yields no further information on what they actually provided.  Several head-mounted displays were presented.  Some look like very early Google Glass prototypes, and others like Oculus Rift prototypes.  Some of the presentations were outright bizarre, like a series of technological dating assistants.

**Rwood-Hurricane-ViPodLx-Ranky-Copyright.m4v**

This video shows the cleanup effort after the "Ridgewood Hurricane" of August 2005.  Since no actual hurricane touched NJ in that year, I assume the term Hurricane is hyperbole.  Workers systematically clear downed trees and branches from the street using industrial woodchippers.  They also finish felling structurally compromised trees that stayed standing.

7. There is one more thing I would like to ask you to do for explaining your company's (i.e. the 5th company's) Sustainable Green focus. Please go on the web, Google YouTube, and then in the field at the top type in 'Paul Ranky' (this is a search field and you'll find it easily). It will show you over 120+ links to short video clips I put up on YouTube. The goal of this part of the assignment is for you to find any 6 short clips on Paul Ranky, YouTube that deal with marine life, (i.e. diving) and use those clips to convince your virtual board of directors and shareholders, that your 5th company MUST NOT POLLUTE the world, in ANY ways, ANY time... it MUST BE SUSTAINABLE AND GREEN; not just sustainable... but green too... these video clips show pristine marine eco-systems that must not be destroyed by greed, incompetence, or human error... Thanks; this will put your company on the map! Well done!To document this, please write a specific statement about your company, how you will prevent any toxic waste or pollution to be generated and released into any eco-system (land, sea, river, or air) in about 50-250 words. Please make sure you reference the 6 videos you have chosen from Paul Ranky, YouTube by putting in their individual filenames, and/or with hyperlinks to YouTube if you have a web-page at this stage already for your assignment. (If you don't have a web-page yet, please add the hyperlinks to the Paul Ranky, YouTube dive video clips you have selected later, but definitely in Assignment 5.) Thanks!

As champions of industry, we have a responsibility to protect the planet upon which we live.  I propose that our company adopt a green sustainable mission with the stated goal of not polluting the world in any way, at any time.  Doing so will not only earn us an enviable status in the public eye immediately, but the investment will pay for itself over and over as our competitors follow our lead.  Those of you who doubt the importance of this charge, I implore you to watch the following videos:

Hopefully you all noticed the amazingly diverse biology of these coral reefs, but did you notice what else was there in the background?  Most of the diving excursions featured in those videos were taken at shipwreck sites, and what should be quite apparent is that despite the vast time these ships have spent underwater, the marine life they affected has yet to recover completely.  The actions that we take will continue to affect the world long after we are gone.

To the end of preserving our environment, GreenSpeed will commit to being carbon neutral from the start, with the aim to become the world's first carbon negative company.  Not only do we refuse to pollute the environment, we will actively work throughout our course of business to reverse the pollution and damage that is already there.  We can start with something as simple as a tree-planting campaign, committing to make up for the forests destroyed while mining the lithium that powers our electric fleet.  Our business will be 100% paperless, and we will strongly urge our clients to do the same.  Small steps like these have the potential to set us up as a global force for environmental good.  I urge the board to consider this direction for our company.
