This article explains Cummins investment in GE Additive metal. This investment provides Cummins with technology that allows them to provide low-cost production that uses less energy, which reduces environmental impact. I personally feel this was a great move for Cummins and that the route they are on with their company is for the better! Celebrating their 100th year and continuing to innovate should be what all companies strive to achieve.

There are a few things that stands out to me as I read this article and relate how this article may support some of the concepts that we are supposed to take away from this class.  I notice the strategic partnership that Cummins and GE have formed.  The goal of the partnership is to provide customers with quicker and lower cost production methods.  From an energy conservation standpoint, this partnership has also resulted in less energy needs and as stated in the article “reduces environmental impact”.  This article supports the benefit of how a good partnership with another company can result in positive business results.

Metal binder jetting is an efficient manufacturing practice for Cummins application. It has strong sustainability because of is versatility. Having virtually zero waste, this machine saves material, energy, and time. From a PM standpoint, it would be a no-brainer to write up a proposal to purchase this tool.

This article explains how Cummins is investing in GE Additive’s binder jetting technology, which was just initiated in December 2017. Cummins is going to use additive technologies on site. Although this is exciting and a potential reducer of production costs, it could also be quite costly to Cummins. If they do not hire the correct subject matter experts, issues with their new processes could heavily impact production.

This article covers a fascinating topic that I did not really have much knowledge of before reading this article. This article presents Cummins investment in GE additive metals. I agree with Allison Cox, the idea that I liked about Cummins technology is their technology has the potential to provide their customers with quicker, lower cost production method that ultimately uses less energy. With less energy, they would be able to serve their customers better and reduce environmental impact. Even though I had little to no knowledge of Cummins Global Manufacturing company, I am inclined to learn more about it since their goal is similar to our project which is reducing environmental impacts and sustainable green.

I am always a fan of manufacturers adopting 3D printing in order to improve agility, reduce costs, and overall become greener; but as I am also a fan of Cummins performance, I am concerned about the viability of parts produced from such a process.  It is known that binder jetted parts come out weaker than other forms of additive manufacturing, and Cummins engines are known for being high spec.  Their 6.7L is capable of making 1000 lb-ft of torque at the crank, so the parts inside need to stand up to that kind of strain.  It will be interesting to see how these “low-volume” parts fare in the long term, and I sincerely hope that they do not negatively impact the durability of Cummins’s diesels.
