This article discusses Stratasys adding Velo3D to their 3D printing. This software enables simulated print predictions, slicing, and process reviews. I personally do not deal with 3D printing for metal, but can assume the software and materials needed are few and far between -- if you want good results. If I were to print on metal I would want the design to be smooth to touch with clean/crisp lines. After reading this article I think the Velo3D was a good decision.

The two big “take-aways” that I got from reading this article was the use of Intelligent Fusion technology and simulation enabling software.  The article mentions that Velo3D’s hardware is designed to reduce the need for support structures and is powered by Intelligent Fusion technology.  This puts the company on the right track of fulfilling green engineering efforts.  Also, by using software that enables simulating print predictions eliminate the need to waste material and energy during development and testing phase of production.

Stratasys Direct Manufacturing is adding a 3D printer called Velo3D. This is a different 3D printer which uses additive manufacturing technology. This in combination with the Sapphire system that is used with the Velo3D, allows for more complicated printed structures. This technology could allow for printing complex parts needed for manufacturing quickly. Although this technology is exciting and interesting, I wonder what differentiates this pieces of equipment from some of the other 3D printers that we have been writing articles about. The wording is vague and the claims seen in the articles are not precise. I would like to learn more about the differences between the technology we have been reviewing.

This is an interesting article to read, however, like Lindsey Cabanas have mentioned the article does not briefly discuss on differences between the Velo3D added 3D printer from this article and other 3D printers that are already in the market. From this article, I was able to learn more about Sapphire system and Stratasys Direct manufacturing discovering. It is indeed interesting how this equipment is able to deliver a significant range of additively manufactured parts annually. Furthermore, I think the company’s investment in Velo3D’s system will expect to grow market demand and expand its capacity and support for cutting edge customer applications. Lastly, I agree with Brian Evans that this company is on the right track of fulfilling green engineering efforts.

Powder fusion printing can produce more durable parts than the binder jetting from Article 1 since the metal particles actually melt together during the printing process, rather than being just sintered together.  Both methods of manufacturing require a post processing step to finish the parts, but binder jetting wins on speed.  Stratasys is not new to metal additive manufacturing, so if they are putting their trust in a new technology, that should give its makers a lot of hope.
