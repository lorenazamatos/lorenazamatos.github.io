The article discusses Essentium’s quest to enable additive manufacturing. Reading through this journey was interesting to me because of how they thought and discovered their successes and failures. Working together and focusing on trust is something all Project Management needs to be successful. As stated in the article, “If you don’t have trust you don’t actually have design…” The product testing process cannot actually start until trust is involved with your product, then the truth reveals and you’re able to prepare your product for real life.

This article was interesting to me because it showed a peek into some of the challenges of the electronic manufacturing industry.  To have to think about electronic components all the way down to the manufacturing tools and the material used is very fascinating.  This article shows how customer driven any company has to be in order to be successful.  Through the use of surveys, Essentium discovered 42% of participating manufacturers think 3D printing technology is too costly.  Another interesting comment made in the article is about how many sample widgets that has to be made before a “consumer-held” widget is produced.  This is an example of why being able to simulate things is important.  I thought it was interesting in the way the CEO talked about gaining designers trust in the use of extrusion additive.  This article also gave a very interesting look into the life of a semiconductor designer in the way that the CEO discussed how as a design engineer, 15-20% of his time was spent getting the geometry right and the rest of the time was spent figuring out what material and process can come together to make the part survive in real life.  Definitely a good look into the real world of a semiconductor design engineer.

This article shows Essentium’s growth and development of certain technologies, like additive manufacturing. I think that the energy from the Essentium team in this article is very forward thinking and striving to continuously improve the technology. Instead of just being satisfied that any technology was present in the 3D printing field, they questioned its abilities. They want to scale up technology surrounding additive manufacturing which could be quite helpful and lucrative if successful.

After reading through the article, I can conclude that it was a very informative article about Essentium’s growth in 3D printing technologies.  For starters, this article covered very interesting topics related to manufacturing tools, electronic materials, and their properties. The articles mentioned when customers buy materials from them in bulk, the cost curve goes down because Essentium quoting costs is according to the volume purchased. So the more material is purchased, the more parts will be printed and thereafter more machines needs to be installed in order to print that many parts. With this development, it is certainly for the company’s benefit in cost, time and the quality in providing material equipment. As one of our group member Allison, have remarked, working together and focusing on trust is a key to attain successful project management goals. Group members have positive, different, and intriguing thoughts to discuss on this article.

These guys are my kind of people.  They’re not happy with prototyping scale, they want to see these machines work at production speed, and they realized that they needed to build a beefier 3D printer in order to make that happen, so they did.  The crazy thing is that just because these machines can still scale down to prototype capacity, meaning that the engineers and designers can prototype using the same exact supply chain that they would use on production.  This will reduce variation when moving into production workflow due to the change in machine, while simultaneously reducing the costs because only one set of machines is needed to serve the whole enterprise.  Said designers and engineers will also trust the machines much more because they will become intimately familiar with the quality they can produce during prototyping.  I hope to see a lot more from Essentium going forward.
