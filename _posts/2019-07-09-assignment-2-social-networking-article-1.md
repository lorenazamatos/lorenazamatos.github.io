The article discusses how climate change could cause a meltdown in the US like in Fukushima. As stated in the article nuclear power plants are not prepared for the drastic climate changes. This allowed me to think about the causes of climate changes and if the US can do anything to prepare for it. I personally feel climate is unpredictable therefore we can only provide the materials to prepare for all climates. 

## Brian Evans

I love articles like this that oversimplify a very complicated topic and then use fear to support the writer’s opinion.  It’s funny to hear people say get rid of big government and then turn around and say we need more regulation.  Having the pleasure of being in a nuclear power plant here in the United States I can easily say that they have some of the tightest safety and operating procedures I have ever witnessed, including being met at the front gate by a security guard holding an AK47 rifle.  I would much rather trust the people who will be the first to be affected (working in the nuclear plant) to write the standards than someone that has a lower probability to be affected in the case something goes wrong.      

## Lorena Zamora Matos

I agree with Brian, this article’s title is about 90% clickbait and fear mongering.  Since the Futurism article is just a stub, I will be basing my reaction on the original.  The article’s title portends a coming nuclear disaster at the hands of climate-change-fueled flooding or storm surge.  Said article goes on to list how several nuclear plants in the US have been preparing for such a disaster.  The disconnect is that all of the evidence provided by the article points to the fact that we are being conservatively proactive with respect to disaster preparedness.  Rather than explicit contingencies for individual situations that may or may not come to pass, our government instead elected for a flexible approach to ensure that the plant can either continue operating or at least avoid a catastrophe in the majority of cases.  The author blames President Trump’s deregulation for this without entertaining that all of the experts cited in the article agree that the Trump administration’s broad strokes have reduced the chances of suffering our own Fukushima Daiichi to nearly zero.  The article patently fails to prove its own thesis by trying to conclude that what has been done is not enough, but its own evidence points in the opposite direction.

After reading the article written on climate change and it resulting in Fukushima to melt down in the US, I would like to say 

## Anthony Randazzo

Power companies are made up the brightest members of the workforce. Finding ways to make electricity as efficiently as humanly possible for public good. The fine line between genius and corruption lies here. From the engineers point of view, they completed the  assigned task to the best of their ability. With the bottomline as the top priority, management is to blame for wasting engineering talent to save pennies on fuel. If the power companies weren't such monopolies, these tactics would be understood however this is not the case. Everyone especially Management needs to start pushing for brand new sustainable green alternatives. The author is just as much at fault as management. As Brian and Lorena similarly mentioned, he wrote an oversimplified clickbait article bashing our nation's president to profit from the bottom line. Feeding buzz words to misinformed liberals is a waste of talent and resources that should be put towards the solution.  

## Jamarius Willis

I agree with what Brian and Lorena said about the article being highly oversimplified. I imagine this must've been  a hyper liberal author that wrote this article. As an engineer , often times people will be prone to point fingers at the work you’ve done and if it has a bad effect you take the blame. Everything isn't as straightforward as that though. Usually the project manager or business professional is actually driving the scope while the engineer is treated as a tool in the toolbox of the corporation. In some corporate environments it is the other way around most commonly in software companies. I would recommend that the engineers try to get buy in to the internal stakeholders on green sustainable solutions. Climate change is imminent but if you think about how far back geologist are able to track pre historical events and you think about how once all the continents were together, there are so many things that point towards the climate just simply not being consistent over the many years the earth has been here. So is it climate change that's being caused by us mainly or by the earth's natural process mainly.

## Lindsey Cabanas

I agree with Jamarius, Brian and Lorena, this article is highly oversimplified. The article seems like it is taking bits and pieces of critical information to play into a simple seven paragraph article that could insight a lot of fear from the general public. It does not mention what any of the design flaws that would leave the nuclear power plants vulnerable, and it does not mention if there are any actions in place to resolve the issues. Sometimes there are certain risks that are deemed acceptable, but have action plans to reduce the risk. There is also a Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the united states that has a budget of over 900 million dollars per year (https://www.nrc.gov/). This commission rejecting the potential improvement work is concerning, but again, that statement needs more information. The whole article is severely lacking.
