This article discusses how John McAfee vows to reveal bitcoin‚Äôs creator. Bitcoin to most people is a conspiracy, knowing the creator behind this would help. Bitcoin is defined as a type of digital currency in which a record of transactions and operates independently of a central bank. So why would the creator want to remain anonymous? This is a cryptocurrency therefore cannot be traced so I think one reason the creator wants to stay unknown is so they cannot be blamed.

This is a very funny article.  Sounds a little like the cat chasing the mouse sort of thing.  I would say that McAfee should go for it.  Chase down and reveal this masked man, woman, or child.  I‚Äôm searching for ways to think of how this article can teach me something about project management üòä.  With all of the drinking, drug use, and chasing women, I wonder how good John F‚Äôing McAfee is at project management? I‚Äôm sure he hires a lot of excellent project managers.  From reading Appendix A in the eBook, it sounds like there is plenty of room for improvement in the project management of IT projects.

I was skeptical of this article when it first came out, and history proved me and my kin right when McAfee ‚Äúpaused‚Äù his plan to expose Satoshi Nakamoto less than a week after this was published.  This all felt like a rambling publicity stunt.  Satoshi Nakamoto is, of course, the pseudonym belonging to the person (or people) who invented bitcoin and the suspected owner of the unspendable genesis block reward of 50 BTC.  The issue with anyone professing to know his/her/their identity must be met with skepticism because bitcoin is a concept built around privacy and anonymity.  The concept that its inventor would expose their true identity to anyone is laughable.

This article is indeed an entertainer to people reading

I did not know prior to reading this article that the creator of Bitcoin was a mystery. I also did not know that anyone else in the world cared about it enough to write an article about it. I am now intrigued and hope that McAfee does let the creator‚Äôs name out.

I find this article very interesting because up until now I never really paid much attention to the fact that the owner of bitcoin is super anonymous. It makes sense that he is in a way because it shows how reliable he/she/they are at not only keeping anonymity themselves but also for others. In the digital age I believe that instances like these will be more common. I love how technology can be super profitable, but you don‚Äôt have to be in the spotlight and play as heavy politics as most business acumen focused organizations that have been around for decades.
