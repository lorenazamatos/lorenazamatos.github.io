1. {:value="1" class="bold"}Project Management for Civil and Construction Engineers…

Projects in the civil engineering / construction industry  are  very similar to virtually any project in any industry, and presents the characteristics below:

* A project is triggered or carried out carried for an exceptional case, not as part of the day to day roles.
* A project has a fixed deadline, start and finish dates.
* The project should have fixed budgets and recourses that are also plan around the expected deadline.
* Every project should have a clearly formulated goal

In each project three kinds of activities will take place:

1. Decisions, about the project results, impacts and resources 
2. Work on substance (outputs, activities/ processes, tasks) 
3. Managing resources (time, budget, information, project staff) and quality control.

The project that our company carries out are no different than the approach explained above. Every project is nurtured under unique circumstances. An example of this could be a customer that required that require that we update our inspection plans to be ISO compliance. Depending on the different parts and products that we offer and the different inspection plans, we might end up with a small to medium size project generated merely on a customer request. The possibility=ies and triggers for a project are unlimited but in general the al pursue a goal that is aligned with the company’s objective. Example of goals, could be reduce delivery time, increase productivity and positive feedback from the services, or like the given example, to keep a customer and stay competitive by being compliant with the ISO standards. To attain this goals the company has an unlimited availability of time and resources. For the projects to make sense and to actually benefit the company the goal must be attained with a limited an rationed amount of resources determined by management and the experts. If the resources were unlimited the value attain by the project completion might be lesser than that of the expenses to carry out the project.

Among the activities that will typically occur in our projects, we encounters the same as those for a civil engineering project. The decision-making process is important for every step. IS making the right decisions what keeps your budget and your project on the winning side. As briefly explained before, if by conducting a project that saves millions of dollars, we spend 10 years and our leave expires then we should not commit to that 10-year project. Things need to make sense and benefit the overall budget of the company, as engineers our main objective is to be valuable and create the positive cashflow for the company. It is also important to work and focus in the results and outputs, what is what we are monitoring or what is the value of this things that affect my process. How can I can improve or work with this variables to obtain the best result. And lastly, another general activity that si common to our business is managing the resources. And as inferred from the mere essence of the word project, the are a lot resoiurces that need to be managed in a unique way to obtain the best possible results and to also adhere ourselves to the deadlines that aim to be an optimistic scenario.

Major project phases of civil engineering project: Preliminary Engineering, Engineering, Environmental Clearance, Right of Entry, Advertise and Award, Construction and Close Out.

GreenSpeed shares many of the same principles in respect to projects and how they are defined. In our case the construction phase would not translate to the actual construction of a building nor even the manufacturing of the products that we distribute but rather to the repair and services that our field technicians offer, or even to the distribution of the product. That is our hands-on part of the process. In general, it follows most of the phases that a civil engineering project would. We also required a lot of planning and organization to make sure that the products are in stock and can get to our customer in the desired timely fashion, or depending on the scope of the project we might want to reduce the delivery time to increase efficiency. The engineering parts of the process, design and manufacturing are taking care by our suppliers, but our company collaborates with our supplies to make sure that the designs stay price competitive and we do not receive any non-conforming product that can scape to our customer or cause delays and inconveniences. We trend those issues with our suppliers and in addition to taking internal measures, like increasing inspection, we also guide them to effectively attack the root causes. Advertising and Awards do not happen like in the construction industry but notice that all the processes and projects need to be approved, and that is the first step in our case as oppose to the civil industry where the steps might be more segregated, they are set in motion in a different way. After the project been completed satisfactorily, we have the product or goal fulfilled and the fruits of the work can be gathered, this stage is similar to the close out.

3. {:value="3" class="bold"} Project Lifecycle Matrix...
 
Project managers are faced every day more challenging projects and impossible-like deadlines. This is due to the fast pace competition and expectations of the market and the customer themselves. Regardless of the cause, it is fair to conclude that all the staff in our company should be effectively trained and given superactions opportunities. At GreenSpeed we appreciate our human potential more than anything and know its value. A person who is prepared and has the right tools can effectively take the right decisions and pull the projects along.

Other components that positively affect the projects are our collaborative environment between team members and mate inning a safe and compromised culture that allows for personal and company growth. All the knowledge that is attained by a team member is shared among others according to the organizational charst and company priorities. The quality focus approached where every person in the company holds their end to assure quality has proved to also be effective.

Collaboration is also primordial between our suppliers and other companies word-wide. This would allow for faster and better services and for a quicker invention turnover.

All the information, internal and/or of our customers and the market can be also be used in a better way. That is why in our company we use information systems to better take advantage of the information and make more educated decisions. It is undeniable that the use of information system to direct and better use the resources is become a requirement to stay competitive.  With the training, the culture, and the tools our managers push themselves every day to obtain a completive edge.
 
{:type="A"} 
4. {:value="4" class="bold"} Building Information Modeling (BIM)...
 
Building Information Modeling, BIM, will be not be as important to our company as it is for the civil and construction industry as the modeling part is out of our range as a company. This is because our company does not own the design of the products that it sells, We are a distributors and have no power over the design and drawing of the products that our suppliers manufactured. Because of the type of company that we are, instead of using modeling to create drawings and tools, we use an ERP system that allows to effectively plan for our demand and keeps track of our inventory and optimizes time and resources. Although the graphic part does not translate to our business the use of IS and information to advance the goals definitely translate to any business, including ours.
 
{:type="A"}
5. {:value="5" class="bold"} Building Information Modeling and Generative Design...

BIM brings together the design and documentation information and workflows for the design, construction, and operation of all types of buildings and facilities around the world, from the conventional to the most inspiring projects of our time in the construction industry. As mentioned before in the case of GreenSpeed case BIM and design are not directly applicable to our projects. However, we have standards and a work flow and keep documentation of the orders and the customer historic data as well as that of the suppliers and those who provide services for us too. To do this is necessary to have electronic data filling places as well as systems that allow us to have validated information that can be accessible at all time. This would not only allow us to facilitate the information flow but also would allow to be compliant and have records of all the transaction and operations that interest the company and the parties involved.

It is irrefutable that information system is necessary and there are many uses and application that are available to suit your business model and type. Instead of focusing in design our system would focus on documentation and tracking of customer data, as well as planning status and demand. By facilitating this area, planning becomes a lot easier and effective.

6. {:value="6" class="bold"} Integrated Project Delivery...
 
Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is an important trend and practice in construction project management. It leverages early contributions of knowledge and expertise through the utilization of modern technologies, allowing all team members to better realize their highest potentials while expanding the value they provide throughout the project lifecycle. The principles and techniques outline in this guide can be translated to lean manufacturing in the manufacturing world as it is in fact a methodology that is used to drive a strategy home. The goal of the Guide is to identify the characteristics of IPD and to provide specific information and guidance on how to utilize IPD methods to achieve enhanced design, construction, and operations processes. The goal of lean manufacturing and lean six sigma is to also drive continuous improvement, the difference is that is our process we will be using this methodology to reduce waste, d and reinforce the quality customer focus approach in our day to day operations. These mythologies also accentuate the importance of the human potential by respecting and valuing the people involved in the construction process, manufacturing or any other type of processes. This is aligned with our company strategy where we strive to be the best place for our employees creating the right environment for change and progress.
 
{:type="A"}
7. {:value="7" class="bold"} Specific Construction Industry Challenges and Solutions...

The construction industry has suffered from a productivity decline, the buildings are over expensive, and the projects run behind schedule. The architect with the design ideas perhaps does not have the correct relationship with the process or cannot align their creative ideas with the most optimized option budget wise. Some other things might be disconnected as well as lack of communication. In the manufacturing environment, when someone designs a product, the success of this is based not only on the creativity but also on how feasible the design is.  The design process has in the phases a transfer to manufacturing phase that checks that everything is in fact in place and the company can effectively create the product that was design. That might be an easy example but that is the way to explore the gaps that your process has and improve them. In the case of GreenSpeed the main problem is to keep the handle the customer complaints in a timely manner. Because the investigation process needs to be done at our supplier’s end, we always need to rely on them to find the root cause for the problem. As a result we do not have total control over the investigations and sometimes the only option is to have reliable suppliers that you can trust. Now we trust and verify, buy this I mean that we constantly work with our supplier to solve the issues, and although we do not go to their facilities to investigate in person we have access to the investigation and provide the necessary feedback to improve the process until it satisfies our own quality standards. Over the time we have make  customer/supplier relationship of our company stronger a more harmonized.

8. {:value="8" class="bold"} The Role of Project Managers...
 
The project manager is the star of the show at the early stages of the project, but fades into the background as the project progresses.  In the planning stages, the project manager is responsible for making all of the important decisions: selecting critical requirements, setting requirement priority, and determining how the project will react to any unknown risks during elaboration.  Without these founddational decisions, the project is doomed, but ultimately the project manager is at the mercy of those actually implementing his/her plan.  Once said plan is set in motion, the project manager's role becomes one of (hopefully proactive) damage control - steering the project away from pitfalls and toward the most successful outcome possible.
 
{:type="A"}
9. {:value="9" class="bold"} Predictive Analytics...

According to Ranky, "the entire civil and construction industry, and in particular project management efforts in these industries should deploy predictive analytics methods, tools and technologies" (Appendix A). In most cases this is impossible due to the significant amount of big projects that are owned by the government or get some kind of political sponsorships. This industry should apply predictive analytics like many others to help save money and optimize the resources. This entire industry needs more fair pricing, better capacity planning, better project scheduling. I believe that by freeing the market better results should be attained. And the prices would be more stable with positive impact for the community. In our company these predictive analytics are more intuitive, as it is one of the pillar of our planning strategy. We use this to forecast the customer demand and keep the minimal inventory that would still allow for constant and on time services. We also use statistically valid samples to check our incoming product before is accepted and delivered to our customer. In every order our clients place we offer and estimate and adhere to the plan.
 
{:type="A"}
10. {:value="10" class="bold"} Predictive Models

Predictive modeling is a subset of the above predictive analytics.  It specifically deals with taking past performance and analyzing it to predict a future outcome.  This includes applications like behavioral modeling, fraud detection, and forecasting.  Greenspeed plans to make heavy use of predictive models in order to optimize our inventory levels, payroll, and logistics overhead.  Being able to proactively move inventory around to where it will be needed the most ahead of time is a fantastic way to save us money and establish ourselves as a breakthrough green engineering company.  Predictive modeling also plays into our statistical quality control, enabling us to continue using the historical data we've collected in order to make real-time predictions about our yields, as well as on-the-spot evaluations of our suppliers.

3. Write ABOUT YOUR Engineering Management / Project Management DECISIONS: What are your decisions as an Engineering Project Manager and why? Write about 100-250 words on each main topic in Appendix A, and how these principles, methods, tools, challenges and solutions would shape your company (the 5th company).

    <figcaption>Illustration of project management decisions by Lorena Zamora Matos</figcaption>
</figure>

According to Ranky, “at the early stages of a project … decisions should be based on competent economic evaluation with due consideration for adequate financing, the prevalent social and regulatory environment, the environmental constraints, technological considerations, and others” (Appendix A).  The first decision an engineering project manager should make are the specific requirements for the project.  At the early stages, requirements will be broad, but subsequent iterations will break them down into atomic units that are easily observable during QA.  Immediately after settling the requirements, they must be prioritized: and the priority is the second major decision made by the engineering project manager.  The final major decision by the engineering project manager has to do with the “third leg” of the quality triangle.  In any project, the cost, time, and scope are relative to the quality of the outcome.  If two of the three legs are fixed, then the third must be flexible in order to accommodate for inevitable unknown risks.  The project manager has the unenviable job of managing the expectations of the business, who expect a perfectly fixed triangle.  Sometimes, the timeline is flexible and unknowns can be handled by letting the implementation last longer.  Other times, the budget is flexible and unknowns can be handled by securing additional resources.  Other times yet still, the scope is flexible, and unknowns can be handled by pushing aspects of the project plan into later phases of implementation.  It is the project manager’s role to identify and present such contingencies to the business so that the whole team can come to an agreement as to the path forward when an unknown risk makes itself known.

4. Last, but not least do not forget your social networking content at the end of this assignment, as part of it. (In every assignment this is an executive summary, with a hyperlink to the rest of the material you have documented, based on discussions with your classmates on articles I have sent you by email, all on your web site, NOT in a separate file attached to an email! This part of the assignment reflects your active participation in the class based on discussions of the articles I am emailing you every week or so...)

**[Climate Change Could Cause Fukushima-Style Meltdowns in the US]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-09-assignment-2-social-networking-article-1.md %})**

We all agreed that this article (and the original version from Bloomberg) had some fundamental flaws.  It asserts that the Trump administration's deregulation efforts are putting our nuclear infrastructure at risk from flooding due to climate change, but miserably fails to prove its thesis.  In fact, the evidence it provides actually shows the opposite of what the article is trying to prove.  Considering that climate change is not something we can even remotely describe as "predictable," I agree with the White House's approach of building flexible disaster recovery capacity in the near term, with a long term goal of iteratively shoring up our defenses in an interative way.  This is how engineers do it.

**[Listen to Brutal Death Metal Made by a Neural Network]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-09-assignment-2-social-networking-article-2.md %})**

The whole group agreed that this was a cool application of neural network technology, and that the death metal genre uniquely aligned with the potentially chaotic output from an artificial intelligence cluster.

**[John McAfee Vows to Reveal Bitcoin’s Creator]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-09-assignment-2-social-networking-article-3.md %})**

Since the article itself was really thin and vapid, we elected to instead discuss the meta-narrative of such an article in the context of good, proper project management.  For instance, did John McAfee's extensive experiences with drugs, alcohol, and sex make him a better project manager?  How could he have better applied the topics from Appendix A in the eBook so as to better manage the project that is his sad, miserable existence?  Right before the deadline, I think Avni Patel said it best: "This article is indeed an entertainer to people reading."

6. Further Work Needed

As a company, we believe in continuous improvement, and that every step of every project is another opportunity to iterate on our processes.  Even if we meet deadlines, we strive to beat our own records as well as the competition.

8. Self-Grading

I believe this assignment deserves a grade of 10/10 because all of the items in the assignment prompt outline have been addressed extensively.  This was an assignment where I used more creativity than before, but at the same time applied the concepts learned from the eBook's respective material.
