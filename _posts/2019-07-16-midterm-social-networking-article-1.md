Cleaning the inside of a space station has to be a difficult task, so I can imagine cleaning companies that excel at these tasks get known quickly. Cleaning companies have to do well to become known, so I don’t think they bite off more jobs than they can chew.

I never would’ve imagined that cleaning the space station would be that difficult of a task that a robot would be needed. After this article, I think that the issue is also that cleaning thoroughly so that there is no sickness on board become more critical in space where there are less resources. I don’t have a Roomba at home but I hope that the trials of GermRover go well for the sake of the astronauts.

The space industry is astronomically expensive, I imagine that adding a cleaning robot will not break the bank but was a cost benefit analysis done by anyone? Can the hours that the astronauts would normally spend cleaning and wiping down the ship be better used? If not, I think cleaning is not such a bad job. I do not think everybody loves to clean, but I find somehow balanced to add activities like shores to these people’s lives. The disinfection application of the UV rays seems promising though. Keeping them safe is a great priority given all the circumstances.

Some new technology that comes out makes me think that it was developed just because it could be.    However, the GermRover is worth all of its research dollars and then some!  Can you imagine having to clean someone else space crap?  My God!!  What took them so long to come up with this?  I think there is also a green engineering lesson to be learned from this article.  This is an excellent way to use UV rays to kill harmful microbes.  This same technology works in air conditioning vents.  I installed a UV light in my AC vent last week to kill the bacteria that was building up in my vents, and it works!!

This Space Roomba article was very interesting, one wouldn't just think in their free time about how International Space Station would get clean and all just like Lindsey Cabanas has mentioned in her discussion. From the article, I gather that GermFalcon is a private company specializing in airplane sanitizing tech. I agree with Brian Evans that it is definitely in aerospace favorable if such technology called GermRober Roomba space cleaner could blast the walls with powerful sterilizing UV rays to kill any harmful microbes. The developer of the robot believes that UV disinfection showed to decrease the hospitals' infection rate so in similar ways it can replicate those results in space as well. It would be fascinating to read and learn more about the GermRover robot once the prototype is revealed at the Aerospace Medicine Association.

I never thought much about how space stations are cleaned. Now that I think of if though I imagine it is a very daunting task because there are so many wires and open circuitry to look out for. This space Roomba article is very interesting because not only does the company specialize in cleaning space stations, but they also are very far into the future because they have an autonomous robot doing some of the really hard task. We definitely need more tech like this where I work at Disney in sourcing and I see the large amount of money we spend on maintenance workers and the constant turnover when the job gets too hard.
