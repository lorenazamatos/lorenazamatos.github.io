## Allison Cox

I think eliminating coal-burning plants is an environmentally-friendly idea for the planet overall. The ida of transitioning the world to green habits is a fantastic idea, and I think the United States is finally getting onboard. We are seeing many changes across the world that are environmental changes from electric vehicles to paper straws. 

## Lindsey Cabanas

Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act has a long term plan to get rid of “non-renewable energy by 2050”. This is absolutely a step in the right direction. The boldness and speed of this plan is admirable. This bold approach should be adopted by other countries. 

## Lorena Zamora Matos

I agree with Lindsey and Allison, this in fact sounds fantastic if it were genuine and with good intentions. I wonder how a country that barely survived Hurricane Maria, and the island is still recovering despite receiving over $20 billions of the tax-payers’ money can do such an incredible thing. To directly express my concern, if a company wants to invest in Puerto Rico, by all means do so as fast as possible, but let’s not add any extra retribution to the working class. If going from 2% to 40 is something that PJ Wilson can do, then congratulations, but let’s keep the expectations real. 40% is a huge number even for the greatest country in the world, aka United States of America.

This is a short article, but it covers a lot of ground.  Five years ago, if you lived outside of California, you heard little about renewable.  Now it’s the norm.  40% in five years is a BIG challenge, but there are government incentives that will help Puerto Rico reach its goal.  It’s not going to be cheap and that’s a challenge for Puerto Rico.  It’s going to be a big political challenge.  The president supports coal, but as we know, him and Puerto Rico doesn't have the best of relationships.  My guess is Puerto Rico will install solar and battery storage.  The land will be an issue.  Fixed tilts solar systems need the right angles to the sun and system that track the sun are expensive.  Renewable energy is sexy.  Everyone love the sound of it.  However, the casualty of going green is that many long term good paying jobs are lost and replaced with temporary low skilled and low paying jobs.  The folks that work at these coal fired plants make good money to support their families (and their economy).  However, they will be casualties of change.  All the coal fired plants in the United States have spent millions of dollars for filtering systems that allow their plants to filter out the bad stuff and meet EPA requirements, but unfortunately, that’s not going to be good enough for our society.  Just look at how “green” not just “clean” we are being pushed in this class.

After reading the article, for sure I agree with my classmates on here. It does sound incredible how Puerto Rico has taken up this risky project just to keep the country safe. Not many countries are able to take action against pollutions and support in keeping the environment clean. Puerto Rico is planning of not having non-renewable energy sources by the year 2050. It is interesting that in about 5 years, Puerto Rico will move from 2% to 40% of its renewable sources. That would be the biggest challenge the energy sources industry would be facing. Thinking of all the financial situation and political situation this will be interesting. It is important for everyone to understand and acknowledge the serious threat against the environment.

I think this was a very interesting article because I’m serious about going green. I can only imagine the magnitude of this if southern states in the united states tried methods similar to California and Puerto Rico in this instance. It sucks that in most cases it takes natural disasters happening for people to finally wake up and say “hey we need to take care of the environment”. This is a dramatic change for puerto rico but well needed. I'm curious to see how the project goes 10 years from now.  When it comes to renewable energy here at Disney most of our parks are powered by a large farm of solar panels.
