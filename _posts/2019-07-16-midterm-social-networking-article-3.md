I think commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products are a huge threat to products because they offer similar products for a low cost. If it is a small item I think most customers will go for the COTS product, but if it is a larger item or an important items, then customers will spend the amount necessary. Quality over quantity goes a long way.

Commercial off-the-shelf products, have a use and so do small specialist component suppliers. Working in a production environment, it can be seen that it does not always make sense to use the most expensive part. Part obsolescence may happen and as always, companies adjust and create work arounds and alternatives.

The risk of obsolescence will always be there, progress is inevitable, and when a better product comes with a better price, the latter prevails. Commercial off-the-shelf products (COTS) will always be used because is a great economic option, if things are going to be made obsolete anyway, we might as well find the most optimal way to make them. I think it always makes sense to mass produce, when the demand is there and the product is generic enough. So to go back to the unanswered question in the article, I think that the odds stacking up against small specialist component suppliers in the same way the major supermarket shelves are stacking up against the small independent traders are very close. At least the growth and potential seems to have a similar curve.

What this writer is describing is exactly what happens when a store like Walmart shows up in a small town.  Unfortunately, as consumers…we are left with no choice once the “mom and pop” stores closes.  We have to adapt to our new situation.  I agree with the writer that “engineering and procurement functions are specialized and need the highest levels of expertise and reliability that COTS can’t provide.  But like all of us Walmart shoppers, which some of us are also engineers,…..engineers will have to adapt because we’ll be left with no choice in some circumstances.
