Trello is a deceptively simple project management tool provided by Atlassian, Inc. that facilitates the record keeping and process of innumerably different project management methods.  Tools like Trello are easy for newcomers to pick up because of their sheer simplicity, but this simplicity simultaneously grants the tool an extreme amount of flexibility and extensibility, which power users can leverage to great effect.  With respect to GreenSpeed, I believe that we would best be served by combining Trello with a Phase-Gate Process, or waterfall model for our software development – they are the same thing.

The phase-gate process is a project management workflow method in which an initiative is divided into discrete phases separated by decision points called gates.  At each gate, a governance board or steering committee evaluates whether the project is ready to proceed onto the next phase.  Since recycling a project to an earlier phase results in a major resource-sink, significant time is spent in the top few phases – especially discovery.  For this reason, phase-gate is sometimes referred to as an example of Front-End Loading or Big Design Up Front.  This quirk of backwards movement being extremely costly resulted in the “waterfall” nickname when phase-gate was applied to software development.  Traditionally, there are 6 phases to an engineering project:

1. {:value="0"} Discovery
2. Scoping
3. Building the business case
4. Execution
5. Validation
6. Launch

Discovery is where new projects land while being fleshed out.  The project team is charged with first brainstorming and formulating a roadmap for the project, as well as iterating on any necessary Proofs of Concept needed to establish feasibility.  Studies may also be conducted to ensure marketability of the project.  During this phase, the project board will be created and its workflow methodology will be decided by the project manager.  If the project is in the engineering discipline, they may choose to format the board as Kanban, or as a phase-gate project itself.  If software, they can choose scrum or waterfall.  This step is numbered zero because at this phase the company has not yet elected to pick up the project or invest any serious amount of resources into it.  The project is purely in a conceptual and exploratory stage.

Scoping involves building out the marketing strategy that was touched on during Discovery.  The competitive matrix for the product is thoroughly explored during this phase, in order for developers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their product in the marketplace.  If an already crowded marketplace is discovered here, and the product has nothing to make it truly stand out against the competition, there is a good chance that the project will be cancelled.

Building the business case is the final concept phase of the project, and is where all of the loose research in the prior phases becomes concrete.  The project team starts by formalizing their product definition and analysis.  This includes all of the user surveys and customer studies to establish value, benefits, and features of the product; the market analysis, including size and segmentation, rate of growth, and what marketing channels best reach the customers in this market; and finally, the competitive matrix.  A thorough proof of concept, including cost analysis for production, operation, marketing, and launch; business analysis for requirements; and risk analysis will round out the product definition.  The next milestone is the business case itself, which is a formal document describing the rationale behind starting the project in the first place.  It includes the aforementioned product definition, as well as legal and regulatory requirements, health and safety considerations, an outline of assumptions in the product definition, and a list of criteria or bounds that will necessitate an emergency business case review.  The third milestone is the project plan, a schedule of events and milestones for the project development process, culminating with the project launch, as well as a list of the required resources to meet each milestone’s deadline.  The final milestone of the business case is a feasibility review of the first three milestones, which is also the gate for this phase.

Execution puts into practice all of the planning that took place up to this point, culminating with the delivery of a prototype.  Simultaneously with the development of the prototype, the marketing plan and production strategy are also put in motion so that any changes can be taken in stride and so that mass-production can start immediately after the prototype is validated.  Ideally, execution gains momentum as it proceeds, as the company will commit more and more resources to the project as it matures.

Validation takes place in three phases, and seeks to evaluate the product itself, as well as the production and manufacturing process, customer acceptance of the product, and the financial merit of the project as a whole.  Near testing occurs first, using in-house staff and a very mature prototype – ideally the product used for near-testing is identical to the one that the execution team planned to release to market.  Said execution team usually monitors near testing closely so that they can make adjustments to the prototype based on feedback.  Field testing follows near testing, and involves outside resources.  In software, the field test is referred to as the “beta” test, and customers often see it as a privilege to be invited.  The marketing team uses field testing to gauge customer engagement and interest, and the production team can use the same time to gauge the product’s durability in the customer’s hands.  A third, optional, testing phase can be used if there are any doubts in the marketing strategy.  Market testing involves the simulated release of the product for purchase, followed by trial sales to actual customers.  The goal of this testing phase is to solidify the sales forecast and marketing strategy in order to maximize revenues.

Product launch involves starting production lines with volume targets aligned to sales projections.  Sales and marketing are engaged to price the product in the market and start advertising.  Sales teams are trained and engage their network of resellers and distributors to get the product into customers hands quickly.

In between each phase, the steering committee or governance board meets to make a decision as to the future of the project.  They will evaluate the project and come to one of the following conclusions:

- Go: Proceed to the next phase
- Hold: Stay in the current phase
- Kill: Project is cancelled
- Recycle: Revert to a prior phase

Go and Hold are the most straightforward decisions to make.  If a project needs more work before proceeding to the next phase, then it has to stay put so that the team can continue working.  Kill is straightforward, but becomes increasingly difficult to reach as more resources are spent (engineers are not immune to the sunk-cost fallacy).  The most common way for a project to be killed is if it is revealed to have little-to-no return on investment during discovery or scoping.  The last option is to recycle the project up to an earlier phase, usually all the way to discovery.  It is most often used when an unknown variable impedes further progress in scoping, execution, or validation.  As a check against the aforementioned sunk-cost fallacy, recycled discovery should be extremely likely to result in a Kill decision unless the team can come up with a foolproof plan to overcome whatever limitation or issue resulted in the recycle decision to begin with.

Trello presents its users with the ability to create boards.  Each board consists of a series of vertical lists.  Each list requires a name, and consists of a series of cards.  Each card requires a title, and can contain a longer description, a checklist of items to be completed or addressed, a series of labels, a due date, attachments (like Word documents or PDFs), and it can be assigned to a person.  For advanced use cases, Trello has a series of plugins called Power-Ups which enable additional functionality and reporting.  Furthermore, anyone with software development ability can now interface with both Trello’s REST API or roll their own power-ups to cover just about any use case imaginable.  This is a tool which is simple and easy-to-use on the surface, but with a nearly infinite capacity for extension and customizability.

At GreenSpeed, we would start out creating an overarching “Projects” board.  This board would contain lists for each of the phases above.  New projects land on the Discovery list and stay there until the governance board or steering committee attached to the project decide that it is time for the discovery to be cancelled or for the project to be officially picked up for scoping.

During discovery, each project will receive its own board, which the assigned project manager will manage to his or her pleasure.  Each project board will be free to adopt their own methodology, and this is where the flexibility of Trello as a Project Management system-of-record really shines.  Kanban projects can exist alongside Phase-Gate and Agile software can exist alongside waterfall with no conflicts.

Trello will also be used for company-wide standard process monitoring; for instance, handling complaint resolutions from our clients.  Trello allows you to see the current state of complaints in-flight at a glance, while also enabling periodic exports to a long-term database.

**[This Space Roomba Could Clean the ISS While Astronauts Sleep]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-16-midterm-social-networking-article-1.md %})**

None of us had really considered how the ISS had been getting cleaned before, and once we explored that astronauts really could not afford to get sick we agreed that the GermRover was probably a good idea.  That said, we were all concerned as to whether or not anyone had done a cost-benefit analysis before spending the money.

Most of us were skeptical that Puerto Rico can pull this off.  Brian brought up the negative impact to the island's economy when you replace long-term power plant jobs with a short spike of renewable implementation jobs and then significantly fewer maintenance jobs for the green infrastructure.

We all agreed that COTS products are a good shortcut, but no substitute for bespoke products backed by proper engineering.  Engineers are adaptable enough to survive any sort of market trend.
