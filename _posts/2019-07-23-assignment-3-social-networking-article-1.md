“In December 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law” (Sprovieri). This article reflects on the economic growth in the first year with this lower corporate tax. Manufacturers are thrilled to be moving shop back in the United States and so is everyone else. Architects, engineers, contractors, lawyers, and so many more are hired to design the building. Once the facility is complete, the next step is to hire hundreds of employees. Employees in need of food, homes, the various creature comforts. This circulation of money is essential to the economies sustainability. Quality standards and much easier to monitor inside the country and has a better reputation.

Economic changes seem to amaze me to be honest. I am not a frequent follower of the news and economy issues, but sometimes I feel that the increase and decrease of the economy should not be a shock and we should be able to monitor better. Lower corporate tax seems to be a wonderful change from this article, so I hope to see more changes like this in the future.

This article talks about how there's an increase in the manufacturing industry due to Economic Growth and Tax Cuts because President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December 2017. After carefully reading this article, I totally agree with Allion Cox, that a person who is not a frequent follower of the news, and economic issues, it is surprising for me learning about  Economic Growth and Tax Cuts. It is interesting to know that due to Economy Growth and Tax Cuts, affecting areas are like labor costs, material costs, quality improvement, and large capacity. As a matter of fact, it is astounding to learn that out of all industry, medical device manufacturing is not concerned regarding direct labor costs. It was said that Medical devices tend to be small, high-value products produce at high volumes so they are ideal candidates for automated assembly. Whereas larger facilities have to think about labor costs. Lastly, I think it would be great to see growth in America regarding manufacturing companies.

I agree with Anthony, but sadly some people do not give credit where credit is due.I am very excited with the work that the current administration has done, this USA reminds me of the one that I used to dream about when I was younger and living in a less fortunate country. I was flabbergasted when I heard of the tax cuts, one of the biggest and greatest changes that have been done for this country's economy in a while. I hope they keep the good work and start turning the odds in favor of the working class. I just got a permanent position before even graduating with my BS and I know that it is in part due to the economic growth that this country is seeing. Jobs were always the answer.

After reading or hearing about the decline of the manufacturing industry for years, it’s good to see that this sector is doing well.  Although I know stats can be twisted and turned to paint any picture a writer wants, I do feel that overall things are better for the manufacturing industry here in the United States. Living in the panhandle of Northwest Florida and making several trips from here to Atlanta, it was really thrilling to see large automobile manufacturing plants pop up several years ago in the southern Alabama area.  This article even mentioned one of those plants, and this article makes me feel like that plant will be around for a long time!

As someone who works in manufacturing it’s encouraging to hear that there is growth occurring in this sector in the United States. For an automation company, like Epson Robots, companies being forced to reduce costs could mean more automation. Another aspect outside of cost that could encourage companies to spend more money on automation and items that help operators complete work more easily is the issues being seen of “repeat motion injuries” that can oftentimes be seen on production lines. A topic also seen in this article is the idea of increasing capacity in manufacturing sites. Automation and lean techniques are used to help increase production capacity without necessarily purchasing or renting additional space. This article was a very interesting read for me as I think manufacturing is exciting and changing everyday.
