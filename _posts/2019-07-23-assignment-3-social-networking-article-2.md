Technology today is outstanding, I think we are on our way to some of the fastest flights around. This article discusses how precooler technology is allowing a wide variety of high-speed flight and how the test was successful. The advancement in technology across the world, soon WALL-E will be real life.

It is interesting to note that the SABRE air-breathing rocket engine has successfully passed the first phase of high-temperature testing. The SABRE air-breathing rocket engine is made by Reaction Engines. Not many people would think about how the heat exchanger is achieved in rockets. Reaction Engines' precooler heat exchanger technology enables a wide variety of high-speed flight because it is designed directly for high temperatures. I think this is a fantastic concept to enable technology for advanced propulsion systems and other commercial applications. The article also mentioned that Precooler is a key element of Reaction Engines'.

I agree with Allison, this technology is amazing. I think it to have an edge in this technologies can lead to positive things. I hope the government keeps a close eye on this, because this can be game changing to prevent or win a war. I am not a fan of the government intervening with businesses but at the same time think that just owning such advanced technologies and inspiring fear can help prevent world chaos, and when at war, winning is the only option.

Really interesting article.  I wish the author would have mentioned what the future commercial plans are for such an aircraft.  Already, it only takes me a little less than an hour to get from Pensacola Florida to Atlanta Georgia, but it would be pretty cool to get there even faster.  However, with the engine producing 1.5MW of heat, enough power to provide electricity to 1,000 homes, I could only imagine what that plane ticket would cost.  There will probably be a lot of opportunities for the designers to incorporate energy conservation measures for this supersonic aircraft; however, they don’t need to waste their time asking me to help……. I suck at thermodynamics!

I think that the specifics that are mentioned in this article are fascinating. I am curious what this means in application, as I am not familiar with what advanced propulsion systems means for commercial applications. I also agree with Brian in regards to how this invention will impact the cost of flights, as flights are pretty ridiculous in cost right now without this additional technology. I am also curious of the implications or possible improvements this technology could mean for flight safety.
