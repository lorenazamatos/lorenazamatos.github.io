## Allison Cox

This article discusses Midlands Aerospace Alliance, which supports the aerospace sector across the Midlands, has signed up as an affiliate partner of Make UK. This is a partnership will combine many people and their expertise. This is something I am not familiar with but I believe any alliance can be beneficial.

First things first, this article talks about Midlands Aerospace Alliance signed up as an affiliate partner of Make UK. Midlands Aerospace Alliance supports the aerospace sector across the Midlands. Similar to what Allison Cox have said, I haven't heard much or have knowledge related to Make UK so this article was not much interesting to me. I think it is good that Midlands Aerospace Alliance has joined in Make UK's broader engineering coverage because Midlands Aerospace Alliance is at the highest level of Government when it comes to policy discussions about manufacturing. So their voice will be heard and will surely make a difference. Lastly, it would be interesting to know what new changes they will adapt and it wouldn't be a new topic for me since now I have learned about them.

I never heard of Make UK before, but it seems they are growing and becoming powerful as Midlands Aerospace Alliance was looking for more leverage and recognition by pursuing this alliance. Of course the benefits will be mutual as it seems the way to obtain power for Make UK is through alliances and friends. It seems that they are mixing power with politics like almost everybody else, but I am not sure how the situation is for them or how much stronger they are becoming after this alliance.

This article is an excellent example of the benefit of two companies collaborating to reach positive results.  In this article, a civil aerospace company collaborated with a defense supply chain company.  As a result, the two gained broader engineering coverage, expertise relating to skills and people, and a voice to be heard in Government policy.

Like Lorena, I have never heard of Make UK ever. I’m glad that they are growing and continuing to be beneficial with the use of the defense industry supply chain knowledge. It’s always great to read and learn about partnerships and groups that are mutually beneficial for all organizations involved.
