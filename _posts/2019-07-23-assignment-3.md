2. HOW these apply to your company.

{:type="A"}
1. {:value="1" class="bold"}Pollution by the Construction Industry

I agree with Paul Ranky’s comments that the construction industry is a huge source of pollution. Sadly, this goes unnoticed or is disregarded by many. Some examples of pollution include stone and dust pollution, air contamination, chemical contamination, and particulate emissions. Dust and small particles often go beyond the enclosed area and this kind of particles can harm people and life beyond in the vicinities. Noise pollution and water pollution is often disregarded until it affects someone. I think the important part is to be proactive rather than wait until one experience the negative effect of the contamination. Although GreenSpeed is not a construction company we apply a proactive approach to avoid pollution and be green and sustainable through all the phases, including the conception of the business itself. For us, eliminating pollution, that might be even disregarded by others is a priority. All other companies use regular fossil fuel for operations and transport. Although this seems the most economic option in the short term, fossil fuels are undeniably hurting our environment. One way or another someone is going to pay for the difference, the first step is recognizing it and starting to prevent the issue from happening. In this sense, the challenge that the construction companies face with respect to pollution is very similar to any other.

{:type="A"}
2. {:value="2" class="bold"} Air Pollution

All of us have, at some point, passed by a construction site. Even when keeping a safe distance, the air pollution is clearly visible. Some of the activities that contribute to this pollution are land clearing and leveling, use of diesel engines and machinery that are sometimes old and produce big quantities of dark smoke, demolition, burning and working with toxic materials, stone dust and particles when cutting material, concrete and others. These conditions cause health problems like Breathing difficulty and respiratory systems, asthma, tissue damage, ex. lungs, cancer etc.  It could also worsen existing respiratory conditions. This contaminated air is not only hazardous for human health but also for other animals and the ecosystem. In our company we understand how air pollution can spread and affect people that are not involved in our business therefore we try to respect people by minimizing pollution as far as we can. By using electrical vehicle, we reduce the smoke emissions and safe energy by using a more sustainable source. This in a way also reduces air pollution because every industrial process even the ones used at the fossil refineries create air pollution. We are innovators by taking this initiative and by doing so expect not only have a competitive edge in the long term but also motivate other business to follow and join in the effort to reduce pollution. 


{:type="A"}
3. {:value="3" class="bold"} Water Pollution

Some sources of water pollution on building sites include: diesel and oil, paint, solvents, chemicals, cleaners, heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, led and other harmful materials and chemicals, construction debris, dirt, and others. However, GreenSpeed is more concerned with the water pollution caused by our shipping operations.  Ocean freight transport is often touted as being more ecologically responsible due to the fact that its CO2 emissions are miniscule compared to air freight.  However, CO2 does not tell the entire story.  Freighters burn fuel oil, not jet fuel, and the non-CO2 emissions from burning fuel oil are actually more harmful to life than that of jet fuel.  There are steps that can be taken to minimize the impact, like slow-steaming the boat if time permits, but the impact continues to exist.  Ships also pollute the ocean with concentrated dumps of blackwater and greywater, which propagate invasive bacteria, and promote algal blooms which deplete the oxygen and decimate fish populations.  This passive pollution, coupled with the risk of animal impacts against the ship and oil spills, means that GreenSpeed cannot hope to meet its goal of not polluting the planet in any way if it needs to rely on ocean freight for its business.  That is why one of our core competencies is in localized, domestic Just-In-Time fabrication to avoid having to source parts from overseas.


{:type="A"}
4. {:value="4" class="bold"} Noise Pollution

Some sources of noise at a construction site are vehicles and machinery, heavy equipment, and people shouting over the noise. There is also a lot of hammering, drilling, explosive and other tools that produce extraordinary amounts of noise when demolishing or constructing. This noise can be harmful to human and animal alike, causing hearing loss and some other disturbances like stress, loss of concentration, and overstimulation among others . Depending on the levels and the exposure time and frequency, there are many regulation that are followed, specially here in the USA to protect worker by reducing the noise with engineering controls and/or providing them with protective equipment when necessary. Some other countries are less fortunate and there is need for awareness and safety, but here in USA it’s the duty for every company and required by law. I think in general trying to reduce noise and control it is a better way to approach the problem as in some cases many workers slack wearing their protective equipment and, animals no not ger to have any protection. At GreenSpeed, we do not produce much noise as the majority of the noise occurs in the manufacturing areas and that is under our suppliers’ control. In regard to the vehicles and equip, ent that we use for distribution, it is new and well-kept so noise polution is out of the question for us.


{:type="A"}
5. {:value="5" class="bold"} Measures to Prevent Pollution / Toxicity

In the construction industry as well as any other, a good practice is to take a proactive approach rather than reactive. To do so it is important to try to make your system safe through design and minimize the things that can go wrong. Risk assessment is primordial for this reason, it takes this into consideration and further analyzes what can go wrong in the process, in this case what can create pollution.

Ranky details these specific measures can then be taken to mitigate the following risks:

* To prevent erosion and run-off, minimize land disturbance and leave maximum vegetation cover. (Note, that there are natural ways of preventing erosion by planting the appropriate flowers, bushes and trees, as well as by landscaping.)
* Control dust through fine water sprays used to dampen down the site. (Note, that this is a very simple, low cost and realistic solution in most cases when stone, marble, or concrete must be cut. It even extends the life of the blade of the saw! ... not to mention the lunges of the people around the area...)
* Screen the whole site to stop dust spreading, or alternatively, place fine mesh screening close to the dust source. (Keep in mind, that the best solution is to capture dust / prevent dust at source!)
* Cover skips and trucks loaded with construction materials and continually damp down with low levels of water.
* Cover piles of building materials like cement, sand and other powders, regularly inspect for spillages, and locate them where they will not be washed into waterways or drainage areas.
* Use non-toxic paints, solvents and other non-hazardous materials wherever possible.
* Segregate, tightly cover and monitor toxic substances to prevent spills and possible site contamination. (Of course, as always the best solution is to completely prevent access to toxic chemicals.)
* Cover up and protect all drains on site.
* Collect any wastewater generated from site activities in settlement tanks, screen, discharge the clean water, and dispose of remaining sludge according to environmental regulations.
* Use low Sulphur diesel oil in all vehicle and equipment engines, and incorporate the latest specifications of particulate filters and catalytic converters. (Even better: use electric cars and trucks, then there is no diesel oil contamination!)
* No burning should be authorized of any materials on site.
* Reduce noise pollution through careful handling of materials; modern, quiet power tools, equipment and generators; low impact cutting and splitting technologies; and wall structures as sound shields.

GreenSpeed underwent an arduous risk assessment process to analyze the damage to the environment and the pollution that the company could cause. It was a major capital investment, but with the benefit that our transportation system minimizes pollution.  Before committing to this big investment we also analyzed what kind of damage the batteries and the technology would cause to the environment. In our case we do not have to deal with various sources of contamination as we are only a service/distributor company but regardless of this, the risk analysis and the impact of our action should always be done.

{:type="A"}
6. {:value="6" class="bold"} Pressure to Clean Up: The key problem is law enforcement

Many regulatory bodies like UK Environment Agency and other and USA EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) are putting increasing pressure on construction companies to reduce pollution and conform to environmental regulations. But if this regulation are in place how we still see a lot of companies that still pollute in huge scales? In a way is a crime but it sometimes goes undenounced. This is true for many offenses and crimes, especially when it comes down to people who might fear retaliation from the company. I experience something similar while working on my senior project, the operator that worked there had received periodically small burns and never received protection although the company claim to be OSHA compliant. The reason why she di not denounce the company was clear to me, I myself did not want to take part in denouncing them, as I feared that her position could have gotten terminated. Likewise construction companies ignore all the damages and pollution that they cause, in most cause to not expend the money that engineering controls and regulations would take. I agree with professor Ranky, it is a sad situation cause although they might be filling up their pockets, the damages to human health and the environment are far more devastating. In GreenSpeed, we focus on developing a culture where is ok to speak up and denounce the things that are wrong. We value our people the most and one of our strategy to make our place the best place to work includes to take care of our environment and health first and foremost. It is easier for us because in a way the funding pillar of our business was to cause as little damage to the envirement as possible, and our staff carries out that mission.

7. {:value="7" class="bold"} LEED Green Building Certification and Rating Systems

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is an ecology-oriented building certification program run that focuses on lowering energy and other resources while maximizing occupant health, productivity and reducing waste and pollution. They are run by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). LEED concentrates its efforts on improving performance across five key areas of environmental and human health:

* Energy efficiency,
* Indoor environmental quality,
* Material selection,
* Sustainable site development, and
* Water saving

LEED has special rating systems that apply to all kinds of structures and buildings. This rating are used for all type of construction, new or renovations. This is important because it is a innovative system that allows for measuring how green and sustainable a project can be. Projects can gain points to satisfy green building requirements. The number of points the project earns determines its level of LEED certification. The main credit categories are as follows:

* Sustainable sites credits encourage strategies that minimize the impact on ecosystems and water resources.
* Water efficiency credits promote smarter use of water, inside and out, to reduce potable water consumption.
* Energy & atmosphere credits promote better building energy performance through innovative strategies.
* Materials & resources credits encourage using sustainable building materials and reducing waste.
* Indoor environmental quality credits promote better indoor air quality and access to daylight and views.

By having different categories a project can focus on the main resources and risks at stake. For example if designing an hydroelectric water efficiency has a higher priority that building a retail store. This concept is useful in GreenSpeed as well. We have effectively identified that transportation and saving fossil fuel is our priority and the factor that would negatively impact the environment the most.

8. {:value="8" class="bold"} Major Responsibilities of a Construction Project Manager

A project manager is, in general, the person who makes sure that the project goals are accomplished, tracks the progress, and assigns the resources in the meantime. Some of the main responsibilities includes creating clear goals and making sure that they are realistic ones, building requirements and constrains, and assign the most optimal amount of resources to work around the things that cannot be change. Altho0ugh a project manager does not have to be the Subject Matters Expert, SME for every project, but he/she should always have good understanding of the process or project that is being implemented as this helps to more accurately prevent and forecast the unknown. There can be another SME but the knowledge of the project manager should encompass that of a SME. This is why in some case the Project managers can also be consultants and can act as a connection between the customer requirements and the company that they work for. The ability then to adapt to different companies and internal processes and procedures is essential to ensure that the project goes along without fallouts and maximizing efficiency. Although some might be assigned to lead a project and follow deadlines, the project manager title, is a more experienced and consistent role than that. Project manager can adapt to multiple projects with more easy as opposed to an engineer or other worker that might only be capable of administrating an specific project that they periodically work on. A project manager does not necessarily works hands on getting the derivable but rather organizes and monitor to make sure that the objectives are met.

{:type="A"}
9. {:value="9" class="bold"} Risk Identification, Risk Analysis and Reduction

Risk analysis and reduction is a key components to any and all business and respective projects. Unfortunately we are more familiar with process and design risk analysis that attempt to only satisfy customer requirements and needs but are in a way disconnected with the environment and the risk of polluting it. All issues arise from a source of harm that can be predicted in most cases. Although preventing risk through design can be the most expensive option, in the long term it usually guaranties good stable results. In some cases controlling and verifying can be and option if the design does not guaranties more benefits. GreenSpeed, underwent an arduous risk assessment process to analyze the damage to the environment and the pollution that the company could cause. It was an expensive investment but with the benefit that our transportation system minimizes pollution.  Before committing to this big investment we also analyze what kind of damage the batteries or the technology would offer to the environment. In our case we do not have to deal with various source of contamination as we are only a service/distributor company but regardless of this the risk analysis and the impact of our action should always be done.

{:type="A"}
10. {:value="10" class="bold"} Major Responsibilities of the Architectural Project Manager

The specific responsibilities of the Project Manager may vary depending on the industry, the company, and the company culture and stratification. However, there are some responsibilities that are common to all Project Managers, including the following: 

* Developing the project plan
* Showing leadership and direction to the entire team
* Managing the project stakeholders
* Managing the project team
* Managing the project risk
* Managing the project schedule
* Managing the project budget
* Managing project conflicts
* Managing communication challenges
* Managing cultural differences and challenges within the project team

Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. An architectural project manager role is similar to any other project manager role just applied to a different industry and with technical knowledge. They have the same responsibilities that have been covered in this assignment but in the field of architecture. At SpeedGreen we applied the same principles and project managers do all of the above and a project manager stablishes the project goals and arranges for its implementation and success. They track the progress and assign the resources in the to guaranty the most optimal investment.

11. {:value="11" class="bold"} Secrets To A Successful Construction Project

The key to any project is the human resources, talent, knowledge, and experience can be powerful tools to achieve any objective and successfully complete a construction project. Like mentioned before it is also primordial that the project manager is an SME or someone at the same level that one. The team should also be a competent one and there should be order and respect. One scenario that is getting more and more common in my opinion in today’s work environment is management setting unrealistic deadlines. This at the end can demoralize your team when the objectives are not met, let alone some companies that retaliate and abuse the power. This could be caused in many cause by the high standard and ever-changing priorities of the business with the saying that when everything becomes a priority all of the sudden nothing is, but sometimes it is just bad planning and plain and simple unrealistic deadlines. This can easily be archived by project management that do not know the particular process project that they are managing or the general business priorities. At GreenSpeed we know where our priorities lie and have competent and trained employee form all organizational level that we value and try to make them feel good about the work that we do. Our projects are focused and are evaluated for significance and business priorities before start grasping to much at once.

3. Write ABOUT YOUR Engineering Management / Project Management DECISIONS: What are your decisions as an Engineering Project Manager and why? Write about 100-250 words on each main topic in Appendix B, and how these principles, methods, tools, challenges and solutions would shape your company (the 5th company).

<figure>

    <figcaption>Illustration of project management decisions by Lorena Zamora Matos</figcaption>
</figure>

According to Ranky, “at the early stages of a project … decisions should be based on competent economic evaluation with due consideration for adequate financing, the prevalent social and regulatory environment, the environmental constraints, technological considerations, and others” (Appendix A).  The first decision an engineering project manager should make are the specific requirements for the project.  At the early stages, requirements will be broad, but subsequent iterations will break them down into atomic units that are easily observable during QA.  Immediately after settling the requirements, they must be prioritized: and the priority is the second major decision made by the engineering project manager.  The final major decision by the engineering project manager has to do with the “third leg” of the quality triangle.  In any project, the cost, time, and scope are relative to the quality of the outcome.  If two of the three legs are fixed, then the third must be flexible in order to accommodate for inevitable unknown risks.  The project manager has the unenviable job of managing the expectations of the business, who expect a perfectly fixed triangle.  Sometimes, the timeline is flexible and unknowns can be handled by letting the implementation last longer.  Other times, the budget is flexible and unknowns can be handled by securing additional resources.  Other times yet still, the scope is flexible, and unknowns can be handled by pushing aspects of the project plan into later phases of implementation.  It is the project manager’s role to identify and present such contingencies to the business so that the whole team can come to an agreement as to the path forward when an unknown risk makes itself known.

We all agreed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has done a lot to revitalize the American manufacturing industry in a very short amount of time.  Most of us had some anecdote to share about industrial operations returning to an area that had seen its plants and factories shut down long ago.  There was a lot of hope for the future in this discussion.

8. Self-Grading

I believe this assignment deserves a grade of 10/10 because all of the items in the assignment prompt outline have been addressed extensively.  This was an assignment where I used more creativity than before, but at the same time applied the concepts learned from the eBook's respective material.
