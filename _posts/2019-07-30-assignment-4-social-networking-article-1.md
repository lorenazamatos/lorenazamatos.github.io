## Allison Cox

This article discusses how Cotswold Machinery has added to the range of Roscamat electric trapping arms. This is a new model that complements the range of electric machines. This gave me similar thoughts to the past article about evolving technology; WALL-E will soon be real! In all seriousness, this type of technology will be used throughout all industries like aerospace and motorsport and allow us to create state-of-the-art equipment, which will help efficiency for companies overall. 

## Brian Evans 

The electric tapping arm discussed in this article sounds like a pretty diverse piece of equipment that can be used for several different metals.  I would imagine that in this day and time, almost all manufacturing facilities, big or small, has some form of robotic like piece of machinery similar to this to manufacture their product.  I remember in my machine shop classes back in middle & high school, our drills used a form of oil to cool the metal as we cut or drilled into the metal.  It was a dirty process and we never deposed of the oil properly.  I’m curious to know what’s used to cool the metal for this type of machine.  Surely its and green engineered process.        

## Lorena Zamora Matos

Like Brian mentioned, the use of this type of automatic robotic arm is common on many manufacturing facilities. In my opinion for all repetitive processes it would be better to use robots instead of humans whenever is possible, this is because it’s so easy for us to lose concentration. Of course there are many things that still have to be done manually but the increase in the tapping range mentioned in this article can attract more customers to buy this robotic arm as the applications and use is more versatile.

## Lindsey Cabanas

I agree with both Lorena and Brian that this robotic arm would be very helpful to use potentially in manufacturing. I am curious about what the tapping machines could be used for. I would love to see the equipment in application and the wide variety of uses. Although the different materials that this equipment can be used on (steels, titanium, mild, stainless steel, and plastic) I am also curious how the equipment settings must be changed to accommodate the wide variety of strengths in the materials.

I think it's pretty crazy how much innovative technology has been developing lately regardless of whichever industry it is for. In this article, an electric tapping arm is introduced by Cotswold Machinery. I absolutely agree with Brian Evans and Lorena Matos, this kind of automatic robotic arms are very handy in manufacturing industries. By having electric robotic arm machine, i am very sure it must ease man workload on the facility. These machines are designed for tapping in composite materials, as well as exotic steels, titanium, mild, and stainless steel and plastic. Mostly these are used in industries such as aerospace, motorsport, etc. With this tapping machine, you can tap in any angle. The radial arm of the threading machine is longer than 2m. Think about it, this machine can also be represented as an environment-friendly tool since it is not creating any type of pollutant or damage by the looks of it.

## Anthony Randazzo

A company with such history has decided to branch out into as Allison put it the WALL-E world. Anyone can tap holes for aluminum but Roscamat took it to the next level with exotic metals. In today’s age accounting for tolerances is a dying art like writing cursive. It is important to mention that devices like these are very sustainable.
