## Allison Cox

This article discusses the pressing technique HFQ (Hot Form Quench) is helping to shape the future of aluminum in the aviation sector. This unique technique is ensuring that the material reaches it fullest strength and combines mechanical and heat treatment processes into a single forming operation. I am not knowledgeable in this area, but I am fascinated by the changes and techniques occurring to create materials.

## Brian Evans

With all the new advanced technological ways of doing things, it is interesting to know that you can still do some cool stuff with just heat and pressure.  This article talks about a company that has found a way to make aluminum lighter, apparently, without losing any of its strength.  This is a manufacturing process that has gained a lot of interest from the airline industry.  This article also has a good piece about collaboration between companies.  This process requires less resource, the resources used to make aluminum; therefore, it a sustainable green engineered process in my book.

## Lorena Zamora Matos

This even a more interesting approach in my opinion. The research and process for the other article that we discussed is also based on reducing aluminum weight, but it is based on the material composition and reinforcing the metal structure and it is also meant for bigger components. This article on the other hand seems to take a simpler and cost effective approach. They are not only using the same materials but also reducing the need for reinforcement and the manufacturing cycle. I hope that this can be applied to more components and help reduce cost for the consumer by reducing the weight and fuel consumption. 

## Lindsey Cabanas

I agree with Lorena that this is an interesting approach. Using this approach for aluminum manufacturing in larger piece manufacturing could be beneficial for any company that uses aluminum as a component, especially for aerospace and equipment manufacturing. If the dimensional control is as contained as it states, there are many possibilities for application of this technology in real life.

## Avni Patel

This article talks about a pressing technique that is known as Hot Form Quench (HFQ) helping to shape the future of aluminum in the aviation sector. I agree with Brian Evans, this article presented an excellent collaboration between companies. Indeed, this is an interesting piece, it mentions how the material is able to reach its fullest strength and then combines mechanical and heat treatment processes into a single forming operation. I totally agree with Lorena Matos and Lindsey Cabanas, this approach is beneficial for any company that uses aluminum as a material for manufacturing. Additionally, it is reducing the need for reinforcement which is great because its cost-effective and fewer tasks to handle.  

## Anthony Randazzo

I also agree with Lindsey and Lorena that using this approach for aluminum manufacturing in larger piece manufacturing could be beneficial for any company that uses aluminum as a component in manufacturing. Just as Biran said, since the process requires less resource, then itâ€™s a sustainable green engineered process to me too.
