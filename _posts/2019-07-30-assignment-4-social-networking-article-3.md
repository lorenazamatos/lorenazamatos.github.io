## Brian Evans

This article tied in nicely with the last one.  Personally, I’ve taken aluminum for granted.  After reading these two articles, I realize that aluminum is probably one of the most important metals.  These articles amplify the importance for manufacturers to produce lightweight aluminum.  There were a few points made that caught my attention.  One is that lighter weight aluminum results in efficient use of fuel.  Also, lighter weight aluminum helps to reduce noise in aircrafts.  And finally, the article talked about the partnering of companies to reach positive results.  Another example of a sustainable engineered product.

I am still fascinated with planes, they are so big and heavy and we somehow managed to make flying feasible. Despite all the progress, there are still a lot of people who cannot afford flying, or prefer to drive long distances to avoid paying for a plane ticket. I think reducing the weight would be a decisive factor to help reduce the fuel consumption and prices. Definitely have a lot of hopes with aluminum, and I am looking forward to all of these alloys and projects to be successful.

## Allison Cox

I agree with Brain, I take aluminum for granted as well. This article informed me how useful and advanced aluminum is becoming. We are currently creating light weight aircraft to reduce fuel intake and noise while flying. Hopefully, these reduction will help reduce tickets price as Lorena stated. I cannot wait to see what we take to the next level with all the technology advantages.

I know very little about aircraft maintenance or manufacturing, but it makes sense that weight versus structural/mechanical integrity is a constant issue. By working with composites, manufacturers are able to not make compromises in regards to strength and weight. Some of the promises made for this project, specifically lowering maintenance, repair and operating costs made me concerned. As a frequent flyer, traveling by airplane for work four to six times per month, I am always concerned when airlines make decisions based on cost initiatives. I do not trust that these companies always have the best interest or even “safety” of their consumers in mind when making these changes.

In this piece, it discusses how Aluminum Matrix Composites helps in reducing landing gear weight. This article is somewhat similar to the second article that was discussed earlier named pressing home the advantage. Even that article discussed the topic on the same aluminum material as well. I couldn't fathom and actually, it was a surprise when the article mentioned that aerospace manufacturers are currently looking for ways to reduce weight without compromising on structural integrity, and increasing product capabilities and performance. The project aims to make use of new materials and manufacturing methods to develop and demonstrate technologies that will reduce landing gear weight, fuel burn, and noise, at the same time as improving reliability and lowering maintenance, repair, and operating costs. So true, I agree with Brian Evans and Allison Cox that this article displayed another sustainable engineered product and it expresses how this material is very important and resourceful for all industries particularly aerospace industry. 

## Anthony Randazzo

There are so many uses for aluminum in today's world from wrapping a slice of pizza to making a space shuttle. I too find myself taking the metal for granted just as the other discussions refer to. Weight loss minimizes energy consumption for aerospace and automotive industries. Since society isn’t fully electric for all modes of transportation, the more fuel spent the more polluted the environment. This approach proves to be sustainable.
