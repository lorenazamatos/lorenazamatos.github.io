The process that will be analyzed in this assignment is one of our suppliers’. I chose the supplier process over an internal one because the screws are one of the processes that consume more time in the transportation due to layout and other time constrains and this is reflected in our price, also the process is easy to follow for academic purposes, and our company, GreenSpeed does not yet manufacture anything in-house. For this reason I believe the supplier process would be a good example to implement the PFRA methodology and would be more interesting to follow a manufacturing process with production and handling risks than a simpler distribution or service process. This methodology is applied with the objective of identifying and reducing risks in a deeper way where the effects can be analyzed at a component and process level.

The PFRA (Process Failure Risk Analysis) is a methodology developed by Dr. Paul Ranky for academic and practical industrial applications. This methodology can be applied to break down process’ risks and analyze all the impacts and repercussions of those possible failure modes. This approach uses software tools to generate visual aids that automatically indicate what the areas that need more attention are and how well the process is doing in terms of possible things that can go wrong and its impact.

1. Choose one of your collaborative companies, or your own company (i.e. the 5th company) and address how and why you would apply the learned methods and tools to improve it in terms of reducing risky processes.

Ranky’s PFRA method and software tools help identify the major problems and reduce the risk associated with each process step in a proactive way. The methodology applied in this assignments focuses in the process and the effects that each risk along the steps have in the process consecutive steps and in the components individually to better understand the impact and effects of the risks being analyzed. The following diagram represents the thought cycle after a risk is identified.

At GreenSpeed, all processes would have a PFRA spreadsheet as part of the required documentation.  This ensures that the team has considered potential risks throughout the process design, and is at least aware of them.  Most likely, seeing the risks spelled out would force the design team to implement the mitigation strategies as part of their standard quality improvement iterations.

2. Based on what you have seen in the videos (DVD-V and the eBook videos), identify a risky process, and analyze it using the PFRA spreadsheet template (in the eBook). Make up missing data. (I am keen to see that you understand the method, even if the actual data is not quite accurate.) You can use the PFRA / DFRA template as is, nevertheless must be able to populate it with your own data. In order to see a realistic picture I am expecting you to enter at least 12 risky process steps in the first column of the spreadsheet. (Some students in the past entered only 2 or 3 risky process steps into the template, to save time, and therefore didn't see any meaningful results...). Please keep in mind, that the idea about this course is to learn some really useful methods, that you can immediately apply at work!

3. At this point you have seen what is happening in the company, what the project management challenges are, and also used our analytical tool, the PFRA spreadsheet, to identify a risky process. At this stage you need help from your collaborating companies... therefore...show how you could collaborate in performing the above identified improvement processes (to reduce risks, as analysed in your PFRA) with the collaborating 4 companies given you in your Learning Pack

The process analyzed in this assignment is owned by one of our collaborative companies, (name here). This study was a complementary collaboration as the screws are one of our most popular parts and are considerably expensive given the circumstance. Also the inspection methods, go, no go-gauge has caused some discrepancies in the past when receiving and inspecting the product. This is due to the inexact non-numerical properties of this inspection method, one gauge can be calibrated and still reject conforming product so this is one of the reason why we chose to collaborate in this particular project. Our goal was to streamline the process but at the same time attack and reduce all the risks that could lead to wasting resources or delaying the process lead time.  All the risks identified for PFRA 0001 were considered low so no immediate action was required at this time. There is always room for process improvement so some of the corrective action that were identified will be implemented on their sites. Reference PFRA 0001 for the specific corrective actions. This is an example of how unnecessary risks and waste can be reduce and how collaboration can help.

4. One more twist, that you should consider... also make sure, that you identify and explain how sustainable greening could benefit your company.

Sustainable and green helps GreenSpeed as we have mentioned in previous assignments. We value this principle from an economic and moral standpoint and take pride in being as sustainable as technology currently allows. All of the collaborative companies also work and are aligned with our same principles. In the process that was analyzed for this assignment with DC Swiss, we can see that some of the potential effect modes are delay in the process and scrap. By reducing this risk and consequently saving the resources, they not only become financially richer but also more sustainable for the environment. This is because in every process there is energy and chemical that are being used and have to be disposed by other sub-processes that are not part of this process too. For example the water and the containers that are used to clean the parts after they are passivated are used for other product lines and processes as well. All of the metal that is deemed scrap is sold back to the suppliers which reprocess this metal and sells it again. The plant is currently being under repairs to allow for a new layout that allows for a more optimal movement of the parts along the process. As the company expands, it is important to keep the heavier bars and the receiving inspection as close to the production area to not only to reduce risk but also to minimize the handling time in this part of the process where the metal bars are more difficult to move around. All of this would make this a more sustainable process.

5. Point out and document in 4-5 sentences 2 risky, not sustainable processes in each of the FULL LENGTH videos in your eLearn Pack.

Ford River Rouge Complex Tour

1. At 4:25 the tour guide indicates that the vehicle identification is coded to the pallet.  If this is intended to be a single-source-of-truth for work piece identification, then it presents a risk of commingling, scrap, or production line damage due to data corruption.  In the event that a pallet becomes corrupt in such a way that a machine loads an incorrect program, the machine may begin to weld where no metal exists or perhaps move in such a way as to damage the workpiece or itself.
2. At 13:02, Prof. Ranky brings up the weld splatter.  This issue presents a significant risk of injury to any passers-by, as well as a risk of damaging nearby equipment, contaminating nearby materials or work pieces, or even a risk of starting a fire.

EU Construction

1. In the clip labeled MVI_3224, the workers are seen trying to stack that wooden frame onto the existing pile, but stopping to flip the frame over.  This could be due to a protruding nail or other surface defect that would prevent the frame from lying flat.  This presents a significant risk due to potential injury or unintentional damage from the sharp point.  It also belies an overall lack of attention-to-detail that needs to be addressed by the project manager immediately.
2. In the clip labeled MVI_3307, the operator is seen dragging the jackhammer up from the broken surface improperly.  Rather than going straight up out of the rubble, it scoops back towards the arm.  He is also seen digging through the rubble a few times.  This can represent a risk of delay due to equipment damage, as a jackhammer attachment is not the proper tool for this motion.

New York Construction

1. In the clip labeled Untitled 38, the process of requesting tugboat assistance is described.  There are 2 major risks there.  First, there is a risk of miscommunication where either the tugboat does the wrong thing, or the wrong tugboat responds, or perhaps they both respond...there are a number of different outcomes to this particular "Byzantine Generals" problem.  All of them carry a risk of cargo loss, ship damage, tugboat damage, and collateral damage to the surroundings - not to mention environmental damage.
2. The above procedure is inherently risky, even if communication is perfect.  The process invoves a tugboat physically pushing against the cargo ship, hull-to-hull.  Such a maneuver requires skill to push off, and despite their appearances, both boats need to be well maintained.  If either hull fails under the impact force, the ships could be lost and people could be hurt.

Kuala Lumpur Construction

1. The entirety of Clip155 had me cringing.  The window washers are suspended by belay devices and harnesses, rather than a cage.  While this probably mitigates the cage's risk of building damage in the event of high winds, the risk of injury or death due is much greater since the critical mechanical point of failure is smaller and more delicate.  The cage also allows for a degree of redundancy that the harness does not seem to provide.
2. Clip376 shows a cement mixer with its input shaft exposed, and rotating at a high rate of speed.  Leaving it exposed as such carries a risk of both personnel injury as well as equipment damage and accelerated corrosion due to exposure.  Basic safety and security does not appear to be followed at this site, as Prof. Ranky was able to get extremely close to the machinery in operation with a camera, and nobody seemed to even notice.

6. PANORAMA NAVIGATION MAP: In the eBook please find the panoramic navigation map of a small USA town with 360 degree panoramas (very cool new technology I have created and programmed with my brother). Find this panorama set in the eBook, review it and explain how you could use this technology for understanding risky processes, for risk modeling processes, and for reducing risk. Write about 200-250 words on this after having reviewed the panoramic navigation objects, as well as the related links with more pictures, videos and other objects. Please do not ask me to find it for you in the eBook; IF you read it, you'll find it... but you have to read it...

The panorama featured in the eBook is a great tool to use whenever spatial information needs to be quickly conveyed to visual learners. A 360-degree panorama can either be cylindrical or spherical. Both types can pan left and right, but spherical panoramas can also tilt up and down. The panoramas featured in the eBook are spherical, but cylindrical ones are easier to program in terms of user experience, so if there is nothing to be gained by visualizing the vertical access, that programming time can be better spent elsewhere.  Since a video is just a sequence of still images, the same technology can be extended to creating 360-degree videos.

With respect to risk modeling, this technology might be expanded further to allow for the same process to be seen from multiple angles simultaneously.  This will save a significant amount of time because the oversight committee or risk management team will not need to ask "what is that operator doing?" but rather they can answer it themselves by moving the viewport around the virtual environment to observe whatever it is they need to see. Similarly, a process can be rendered as a simulation and presented to such a committee or team in a similar way, allowing for a greater understanding of the spatial relationship between process steps.

7. Last, but not least do not forget your social networking content. (This is an executive summary, with a hyperlink to the rest of the material you have documented, based on discussions with your classmates on articles I have sent you by email, all on your web site, NOT in a separate file attached to an email! This part of the assignment reflects your active participation in the class based on discussions of the articles I am emailing you every week...)

**[Tapping into Roscamat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-30-assignment-4-social-networking-article-1.md %})**

We all agreed that this was a great innovative step for Roscamat, a company with an extensive history that appears to be stronger than ever.  Anthony brought up a salient point at the end: "In today’s age accounting for tolerances is a dying art like writing cursive."

**[Pressing Home the Advantage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-30-assignment-4-social-networking-article-2.md %})**

We all agreed that this new form of aluminum processing is an incredible innovation for the aerospace industry, enabling both lighter and stronger aluminum parts to be manufactured.

**[The Weight Is Over]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-30-assignment-4-social-networking-article-3.md %})**

The group was split on this one, with some members falling into the "this is a great innovative new technology" camp, and others being skeptical because it could be more of a cost-cutting measure for the airlines than anything.

8. Self-Grading

I believe this assignment deserves a grade of 10/10 because all of the items in the assignment prompt outline have been addressed extensively.  This was an assignment where I used more creativity than before, but at the same time applied the concepts learned from the eBook's respective material.
