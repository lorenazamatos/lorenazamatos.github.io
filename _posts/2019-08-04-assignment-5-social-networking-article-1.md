## Lorena Zamora Matos

It is pretty impressive the power and importance of these batteries. The A320 only needs two 28Ah Skyzen rechargeable batteries and this airbus can carry 150 passengers. I am sure that the batteries provide and perform  under extreme circumstances and  during emergencies. In this market being reliable is key to succeed. Skyzen has the reliability along with a variety of designs to fit almost any customer needs.

As Lorena has stated above the power and importance of these batteries is very impressive. The fact that they can be a backup during extreme tragies is amazing, they are like a generator but better and more reliable. They are able to apply almost all customer needs with their variety of designs.

Battery technology is going to be an important player in this renewable revolution thatâ€™s occurring in word right now.  The missing ingredients for solar to replace traditional forms of generation is battery storage. Battery storage allows solar energy to be provided even when the sun is not shining.  However, battery storage is currently extremely expensive.  The Skyzen batteries discussed in this article may become the solution to solar battery storage.  The ultra-low maintenance requirements could certainly cut the cost a bit.

In a highly regulated industry such as aerospace, there is no room for error. This battery is sustainable and has a good reputation to back it. We are projected to see new strides in the energy storage market in the years to come. Skyen will be on the radar.
