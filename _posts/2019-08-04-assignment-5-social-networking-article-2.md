## Lorena Zamora Matos

I love this new tool from Seco. Coming from a third world country, one of the most important things that I learned growing up was to be resourceful and to make a lot with a little. Rather than investing in a machine with more horsepower (that equals to more energy consumption, cost and of course the large initial investment) they created this tool that offers lower cutting forces and has incredible quality results and durability. There are also different inserts with various edges which provides even more options for the machine as each of the 3 edges work better in a specific surface type.

The new tools from Seco allows me to think and realize how impressive our current creations are. We have advanced technology and equipment that helps make our lives easier. This new tool allows machine shops with lower horsepower machines to maximise face milling operations. This tool has great tool life and reduces the strain on the equipment. Soon I think all tools will be as useful and helpful with machinery.

## Brian Evans

This article is about the company Secoâ€™s new cutter.  This new cutter allows machine shops with lower horsepower machines to maximize face milling operations.  The sustainable feature of this machine is that extends tool life and decreases power consumption.  Ironically, Seco is one of the collaborating companies that I had to work with, so it was interesting reading this article.   

## Anthony Randazzo

Running a machine shop consumes a large amount of electricity. To minimize cost, not every machine is overkilled with horse power. As a result there is a demand for tools to compensate for brute force. I agree with Brian that this is a sustainable design approach for Seco to proceed with.
