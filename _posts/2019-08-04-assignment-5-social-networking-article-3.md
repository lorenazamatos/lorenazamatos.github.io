A220 is a revolutionary aircraft with the lowest noise levels of any commercial jet at the moment and it is also a very efficient machine with optimal capacities that can carry 150 people. It is ideal for urban and busy airports. To know that such high end machines is going to be assembled in Alabama brings me hope. It is good to see how the team there is growing and already have started the process with other models and how they are collaborating with other countries like Canada to grow even more. I am very excited for all the progress and the impact that it has in our economy.

Seeing collaboration amongst companies to better the economy overall is outstanding. I hope the world continues to work together for the better, so the economy improves. This aircraft has the lowest noise levels in the business right now, so flying is continuing to become even more luxurious. I believe we will soon be cutting down on the time spent on flights because of the amazing pieces of machinery being developed.

I believe it was somewhere in the literature for this course that I read about how certain sectors of the government will award contracts to different companies for the same project, and these different companies have to work together to complete the project.  This would be an interesting and challenging project to manage as a project manager.  In this article, the project consisted of three packages and five companies on this one project.  Harbert International and FSB worked on package 3 which consists of design-build services.  H.O. Weaver and Sons worked on the Enabling Works Package which consisted of getting the site ready for construction. Brasfield & Gorrie and BRPH worked on package 1 which consisted of design-build services for the building.  I would assume that this project consisted of several project managers for each company and perhaps a head project manager to bring it all together.  Very interesting!

Managing a facility for Airbus seem to be quite a challenge. With so many tools and techniques available as well as government funding, it will most definitely be properly equipped. There is no doubt that this is sustainable. My only concern is if there are enough green components to counterbalance airplane fuel consumption.
