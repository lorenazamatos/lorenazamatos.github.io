This assignment will demonstrate how the content and methodologies explained in Chapters 6 and 7 of Dr. Ranky’s eBook, Project Management Methods, Tools and Technologies will shape our company.  The objective is to apply that information to real life day to day activities and also long term strategies in our company, GreenSpeed. We will also use the information given in Appendix C from this ebook to model a cost analysis based on our previos assignment 12.  As this is a wraparound assignment, I will be using the required chapter’s content and methodologies and apply those to my company but I will also refer to previous content that was covered in other chapters of the ebook like risk analysis / PFRA, TQM, Six Sigma, object-oriented Process Modeling methods and tools, CIMpgr, and others.

0. Part 0 of this assignment is to resubmit all reworked assignments with detailed explanations on what you have improved based on my comments. Note, that statements, such as: 'based on the professors comments I have improved Assignment i, please find it linked here...' are not acceptable, since you haven't specified exactly what my comments were and what you did to improve your assignment. The reworked assignments must be hyperlinked here with a single URL link for each assignment you have reworked, so that I can find them easily. Please note, that at this stage of the course I have a lot to grade, therefore if you don't follow my instructions and structure, send me several emails with several files, or still have no webpage (!!!) I might miss some of your valuable work... so, please help me, so that I can help you and give you the best, well earned grade. As I go through your reworked assignments, I'll change the grade if you deserve it and then I'll add this to the total number of grade points you have earned in this semester in this class. Then, I start to grade your Assignment 5. This is my process and it is more than fair, since most Profs. do not allow reworks at all... BTW none of my professors in my BS/MS/PhD program did allow ANY reworked assignments to be resubmitted...

[Please click here to find my reworked assignment 0]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-06-12-assignment-0.md %}).  As per Professor Ranky's feedback, I made sure to go through the assignment spec and follow it to the letter.  Sections that were previously too short have been reinforced with additional supporting details.

All the other assignments were granted the highest possible grade, and no opportunity for rework was identified based on the prompt in the syllabus.

1. **Part 1 of Assignment 5 (max. 10% of 30%) is a discussion paper, about 500-600 words on Chapter 6 and 500-600 words on Chapter 7, discussing how these topics would shape and improve your (5th company):** I am also keen to see, that the results benefit your company in that you are learning by doing all this work in collaboration with your 4 collab. companies in the eLearning Pack. You have to 'sell' me this; sorry I am representing the Board of Directors.... the boss, the sponsor... Also, there is an important aspect here to be discussed on offshoring / reshoring. There is a wonderful web site with a calculator to help you! This is all FREE of course. Please create your own free account and then login to http://www.reshorenow.org/login.cfm. then create a new case study (with your own data; can make up missing data) and fill in the Input page for Total Cost of Ownership Estimator™. Calculate and explain the results. As a proof I would like to see screen-prints of your data on your web-site of your Input page for Total Cost of Ownership Estimator™... You should explain the results and your project management decisions in about 250-300 words. Please note, that this is a VERY IMPORTANT feature of your project management studies since it relates to what is happening in the real world, with real professional companies! Enjoy this assignment and work hard on it because it is very useful for your future as a professional engineering project manager.

1. {:value="1" #sec1a} **Chapter 6:** Project Management and Marketing Strategies and How These Topics Will Shape GreenSpeed.

The purpose of this chapter is to give you the tools to be able to sell your project. This is extremely important because one of the things that decide whether or not a project succeeds is the resources and funding that you are able to get for it; and to help you with that, you need to know the customer as well as the useful tools to deliver what the customer wants. This chapter also stresses the importance of marketing strategies, in integration with project management and TQM. The key for any project to succeed is to be customer focused, and keeping in mind their different requirements. To do this is necessary to stay competitive and analyzed and collect as much customer information as possible. Getting this information is a challenge, that’s is way IT is becoming more and more indispensable in every type of industry. Our company, GreenSpeed keeps a customer database with their purchase history and information and have a system of email and reminders to alert the customer when service and parts are due for a checkup. Using the information of what the customer does and how they utilize our parts also help predict when they will need to place a new order. We also offer discounts at times when they need to place a new order to reward loyalty and incentivize the purchase. All of this information is managed by the database but the knowledge and actions is managed by a cross functional team, that is focused on keeping customers and attracting new ones. Our marketing and sales department have to find the customer requirements and sell a competitive service/product at a competitive price and in a short time to stay ahead of all the competition and deliver optimal customer satisfaction. Here at GreenSpeed we value time and keep our projects effective in term of resources and manage the information, that is why we used the tools presented in Ranky’s book, (e.g. Risk analysis PFRA, TQM, Six Sigma, object-oriented Process Modeling methods and tools, CIMpgr and others) to better understand, streamline and optimize our processes. Another important aspect of GreenSpeed’s relationship with the customer is the agility and effectiveness of the quality and compliance system. Our customers not only get what the want in the most incredibly and sustainably way, but they also encounter a user friendly system. We offer traceability and compliance to the most rigorous standard but move all the paperwork fast to make sure that there is not any delays that can be avoided. Our electric vehicles are not very economical and worth the price. In addition to this, they are also the new solution for the environment and people all over the world know that. When (el tipo de Tesla) started with the idea of electric batteries everyone told  him it was not feasible. This is just an example that it is a known fact that the time to make excuses is over, more sustainable vehicles are a necessity for humans, and they are becoming more and more affordable, given companies like us a chance to see succulent returns.

2. {:value="2" #sec1b} **Chapter 7:** General Documentation Guidelines On How to Write Quality Project Documents, Team Assignments, and Develop Quality Presentations 

At GreenSpeed we have good documentation practices and value the records of a product as much as a product itself. This is based on our customer requirements and regulations. We serve a variety of industries and deal with different quality systems. For customers in the medical device industry, a screw or fixture, or a service provided to a machine needs to be documented and traceable as safety has a more critical role in those sectors. As a product changes hands, the records have to be kept, and although we do not manufacture any products, we stick to a strict quality system and keep a keen eye on our suppliers. All the data and records of the products are available at all times and each sub-component can be traced down and is available in case of any customer complaint or for reference as well. All of the recognized international standards require traceability records. Good documentation practices are also important in today's workplace due to the need to obtain reliable information in a timely manner. Documents sometimes can communicate more information in a more convenient way. Besides this, the person who owns the information may not be available at the moment or in some cases even might no longer be with the company. By documenting every important piece of information we guarantee more reliability for our customers and for ourselves. At the end the information is owned by GreenSpeed and we are all a part of that bigger whole. Documenting is our way of sharing and contributing to our quality system. Chapter 7 was especially useful because it explained a methodology to focus the resources and optimized the effectiveness of the necessary documentation. For example, we at GreenSpeed have many procedures that tell us how to do things and how to document things is also described in one of those procedures. That does not mean that we do not revise and improve those procedures or create better ones. With a new or existing project we behave the same way. First we analyse the documentation needs, and also the things that can be useful and need to be recorded for the future, either for regulation reasons or just and internal decision. At the same time the methods also change, there is nothing set. The tools can change too. As an example we used to route important documents as hard copy and now most of the approvals are done electronically including suppliers and other external  documents that are sent to us electronically.	We have a software to route documents for approval that at the same time stores all the history and the previous revisions and the information as a whole. This software allows to document all types of documents that we work on, so there is no impediment when starting and documenting a project. As analyzed in this chapter, risk analysis can be primordial during the design and manufacturing. When we conducted a risk analysis for the previous assignment we used information that was already there and was reliable. Imagine if we had to conduct a time study or worse, that we did not know the process throughout! That is unacceptable in today's pace. Even when designing a brand new product, there always should be information of similar products that can be easily accessed and reliable too!	All of the data that we keep helps us improve as we turn that data into information that gives us a competitive advantage and lets us better fulfill our mission.

3. {:value="3" #sec1c} **Reshoring/Offshoring**

As per the results of the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator on reshoringnow.org, reshoring the manufacture of a typical injection mold simply does not make sense for GreenSpeed at this time, unless a customer specifically asks for or needs a part made in the United States.  Our supplier is based in India.  Until last year, trade with India was extremely stable, but in 2018 the Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imported to the United States from India - a tariff that directly impacts this particular tool.  In the months since, relations with India have become strained, but the exchange rate between the Rupee and Dollar remains extremely stable in spite.  Ultimately, none of this risk and uncertainty is enough to offset the fact that such a part made in India is a third the price of an identical part made in the United States.  Even after maximizing the risks as far as I am willing to stretch them for the offshore part, the Total Cost of Ownership is still half that of the onshore part.  As much of a proponent as I may be with respect to fueling the American economy, the ends simply cannot justify the means in this case.  There is a chance that my research led me to incorrect pricing data for the part, or perhaps that I was comparing two very different parts, but the single example that I found for domestic molding suppliers gave the $4500 figure.  A mold of comparable size and complexity was priced anywhere from $1000 to $2000 from India suppliers.  All of the price difference appears to be markup, because the price of steel is stable at $0.40 per pound.  In conclusion, I do not believe reshoring makes sense for GreenSpeed at this point in time.

2. Part 2 of Assignment 5 (max. 10% of 30%) **Based on Appendix C explain in about 500-600 words the cost calculations and methods you would use in your company for achieving successful projects:** Having completed the process modeling study in Assignment 1, review all your process costs and see how could you analyze your costs accurately (also known as ABC, Activity Based Costing!)

The project management principles, challenges and solutions learned in this Appendix can be extrapolated to any industry. To better understand the applications of the material read u=in this appendix I will briefly explain some of the analogies and definitions, for example the cost can be broken down into initial  capital, which includes all the facilities, equipment and large investments of more permanent assets and also the cost of running production and maintenance. The operation and maintenance cost in subsequent years over the project life cycle are very similar for most businesses and includes the following expenses:

* Lease, if applicable
* Staff
* Labor and products for maintenance and repairs 
* Periodic services and replacements of parts/ components
* Insurance and taxes
* Financing costs
* Utilities
* Others

As seen in the book, the magnitude of each of these cost components depends on
the nature, size and location of the project as well as the management organization, and other considerations. Here at GreenSpeed we are interested in achieving the lowest possible overall project but being consistent with our initial plan and goals.
The biggest cost is generally the first investment, when the assets and the facility is bought/rented. In our case was the cost of our warehouse and offices and our electric vehicles. When deciding on the equipment that we were going to use, the option of buying more standard vehicles was there and it was cheaper. But it is in fact equally important to make an ROI analysis and also look at the cost after the business is running. When this was considered the company realized that electric vehicles have reached one of the lowest prices in a long time and the technology is getting settled. In addition to this, after that big investment the electric vehicle offer a lot more miles for the same price, so after you build the charging ports in the facilities you are guaranteed to get a much higher rate of efficiency since all the losses of a fossil fuel combustion are eliminated. All of the estimates can vary, but it is certain that the cost of fossil fuels will never go drastically down a sthey are a finite resource. Tool like Ranky’s  ISO 9001:2008 International Standard compliant process modeling (CIMpgr), risk analysis (PFRA), and requirements analysis methods (CORA), with the statistical methods and tools combined, provide a very useful method to create estimates and make decisions based on modeling real data and are a powerful business analysis tool. Here at GreenSpeed we use the earned value analysis, to standardise the consumption of resources. It is easier to see the time and other resources in terms of money to have a better feeling of what things in general and also savings represent for our company. As part of our EVM (earned value management methodology) implementation we make sure that the scope and plans align with the time and resources and also that the project stick to the success path. To do this, we make sure that we have metrics and indicators that we can trend and analyze. We regularly conduct meetings and trend the results and deliverables periodically to make sure the project stays on track and gets all the necessary inputs and feedback from the team with the PV and the EV. Another important aspect that was learned from this appendix and implemented at GreenSpeed is to better and more effectively communicate. Although we applied different tools and collect and manipulate vast amounts of data in any given project, communicating in simpler ways and not overwhelming the people who do need detailed information is always beneficiary and can save time. Communication and culture are things that are often overlooked but they affect any project regardless of its size.

3. **Part 3: (10% of 30%) conduct a Video Conferencing (VC) session using SKYPE, Apple Facetime, zoom, webex, or whatever other software you wish to use** (free over the web) VC with one of your classmates and discuss each others' designs. Try to create a collaborative sustainable green project management quality audit team spirit and document your findings...This is what you should document professionally (pls. note, that if you don't document this session as below, then I cannot give you the extra grade points; sorry):

{:type="A"}
1. {:value="1"} What was the purpose of the video-conferencing session?

The purpose of this video conference was to interactively discussed our projects and get to know the ideas and details from each other's companies. We wanted to offer each other feedback and comment and compliment the most authentic ideas. It was  also a very nice networking exercise as many of us (7 for this VC) did not know each other in person, despite the fact that we have been collaborating and sharing information for the past 3 months.

{:type="A"}
2. {:value="2"} What software did you use for VC and how? (Must include 3-4 screen prints of the VC session as a proof.)

We used google meet. Here are a few of the screenshots. Please notice that our discussion group is rather larger than most, so we held a larger VC than required for this assignment.

### Anthony Randazzo

**What’s your company name?**

My company's name is Green Machining. 

**What does your company do?**

The objective of Green Machining is to redefine how parts should be produced in the 21st century for clients in the aerospace, medical, and general industry. My company manufactures 3D printers for printing Aluminum at the highest tolerance possible.

**Why is it sustainable?**

Taking the steps in sustainable green project management, HRL Laboratories has pioneered a powder Aluminum alloy suitable for 3D printing. Such technology infers the end produce is only clicks-away. In theory, the user has the ability to create a CAD design in the morning, print the part on their lunch break, and begin quality testing all in one eight hour day. If the part requires revision, simply melt and reuse the same high strength aluminum. As a Total Quality Approach, customers are satisfied sooner for a fraction of the cost. Green Machining is also sustainable because the printers print themselves.  

**What makes it green?**

The facility consists of a solar panel roof with wind turbine generators too. All components of the 3D printer are made of eco friendly and recyclable materials

### Lindsey Cabanas

**What’s your Company Name?**

My company’s name is Green Quality Process.
 
**What does your company do?**

My company designs custom online tools for implementing quality systems. My company also provides consulting on Quality/Quality System issues. 
 
**Why is it sustainable?**

The process of converting documentation to an online process is sustainable as maintaining systems is easier and keep active than storing all related documents physically for the timelines dictated by regulations. Often times, the storage of printed documents is very space consuming. 
 
**What makes it green?**

If anyone knows anything about Quality Systems, they will tell you that they are quite document heavy. By maintaining online systems for documentation, you are able to reduce the amount of paperwork physically used by companies in relation to Quality Systems.

### Allison Cox

**What’s your Company Name?**

GreenWater

**What does your company do?**

Beach Restoration. We are developing a GreenWater BeachComb (BC) which is a piece of equipment that is electric/solar-powered to help clean liter off of beaches and rotate the sand. All to help prevent beach and ocean pollution. 

**Why is it sustainable?**

Sustainable because it is preventing pollution, electric & solar-powered, also maintain all documentation digitally. We try to incorporate as much green and sustainability as possible.  

**What makes it green?**

Our manufacturing facility is serious about recycling and is solar powered as well. All our equipment in the making will continue to be electric/solar-powered too.

**What does your company do?**

General contracting but mainly focusing on geotechnical engineering

**What makes it green?**

We thoroughly conduct state of the art test on the soil,water,and wildlife before starting construction because construction is one of the most polluting professions. Wetlands are one of our most important natural resources, as they are not only one of our most biologically diverse ecosystem, but also the receivers of rainwater and act as the first line of filtration for aquifers.  Our wetlands can become infested with invasive non-native plants, displacing and upsetting the natural ecosystem. WGC has experienced and licensed staff that performs wetland monitoring and unwanted species removal by mechanical and chemical methods.

{:type="A"}
4. {:value="4"} How do you like this video-conferencing approach for collaborative problem solving?

I did like the VC a lot better. As I mentioned before we are a large group that have been collaborating since the beginning of the class, and it was really nice to put a face to those people. Also, I notice that the communication process was a lot more effective than by texting, it was also faster and more easy as we ask questions and reacted immediately to the person who was presenting information. This is a lot better than driving to point X and meeting those classmates. Most of us are very busy and joggling a few things at the time. We did not only have the convenience of doing this meeting at home/work or wherever we were at the time, but we also saved the gas and time.

{:type="A"}
5. {:value="5"} What were the main challenges (e.g. slow Internet connection)?

Since we had several people, the one in charge of sending out the invite was having some tech problems, but that was solved within 2 minutes cause we all have each other's contact information. Internet was not a problem for most of us. I did have some problems with my personal computer as some people in my group said that the sound was unclear and distorted, I repeated myself and talk in short sentences. Of course we have the option of asking for clarification that that did not seem to be a problem. Another classmate had the same problem so I guess it could have been the internet connection.

{:type="A"}
6. {:value="6"} What worked well, and what did not, and why?

There were no other problems besides the ones that I mentioned above. Everything else was perfect, we got the benefits of an in-person meeting without having to travel and reserve extra time.

{:type="A"}
7. {:value="7"} In comparison to a face-to-face visit, versus VC, what is the estimated carbon footprint saving to the environment? How did you calculate this result? (Hint: search the web, there are some really useful carbon footprint calculators for free!)

I found a web site that allows me to calculate the amount of CO2 that is emitted: <https://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator>
Based on your type of car, year and model you can see how much CO2 you emit every year depending on the miles that your car usually runs. To put that in perspective, me and my vehicle alone need almost 200 trees to upset this carbon footprint.  In my case going to NJIT from my house and coming back would release around 70 pounds of CO2. Besides all the time, money and effort that is saved by holding a VC, there is some possible benefits for the environment. It is important that we recognize that, because although not in all cases is possible to solve everything remotely, whenever possible this should be the solution. Keep in mind that the number referenced above are only for one person, myself, and I live relatively close to the school(less than 30 miles). 

{:type="A"}
8. {:value="8"} What are Green Engineering benefits of using VC? More on Green Engineering: http://www.cimwareukandusa.com/All-Green/Ranky-GreenEngineering.htm

As discussed in the previous questions, VC can help reduce the carbon footprint. This is extremely important because besides benefit  the business and the particular person who is saving money on gas or any other fuel, this is also benefiting the whole planet and all of its inhabitants. With this use of technology to our advantage we can start working on reducing CO2 emissions. Computers and this softwares are already available in most companies, it’s up to use to make the best use out of it. Even when interviewing a candidate, I believe that the first few screening interviews should be done by video. There are many meetings, townhall and other events that are being held at a distance, it is important to make use of VC as much as possible to be more sustainable.

4. **SOCIAL NETWORKING. Last, but not least do not forget your social networking content.** (This is an executive summary, with a hyperlink to the rest of the material you have documented, based on discussions with your classmates on articles I have sent you by email, all on your web site, NOT in a separate file attached to an email! This part of the assignment reflects your active participation in the class based on discussions of the articles I am emailing you every week...)

{: .no-indent }
**[New Saft batteries double maintenance intervals for A320 Family]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-08-04-assignment-5-social-networking-article-1.md %})**

The group was collectively amazed at how far we have come with respect to battery technology.

{: .no-indent }
**[Seco Double Quattromill 14 maximises low-horsepower machine performance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-08-04-assignment-5-social-networking-article-2.md %})**

Our group was impressed that there are still companies specializing in serving machine shops that only support lower horsepower cutting equipment, and we were glad that such shops still have a future.

{: .no-indent }
**[Design-build teams selected for Airbus 220 final assembly in Alabama]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-08-04-assignment-5-social-networking-article-3.md %})**

Responses to this article varied from the usual amazement and hope for the future, to a poignant examination of the project management implications of such a complex project structure.  Brian made the salient point that there were 5 companies collaborating on 3 packages to complete the overall project, which complicates things significantly.

5. Self-Grading

I believe this assignment deserves a grade of 10/10 because all of the items in the assignment prompt outline have been addressed extensively.
